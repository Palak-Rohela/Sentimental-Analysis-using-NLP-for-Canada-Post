# Sentimental-Analysis-using-NLP-for-Canada-Post
Many people used social media platforms like Yelp, and Google Reviews to share their experiences with companies like Canada Post, and Purolator. I and my teammates scrapped social media data to build a sentiment analysis model that can analyze social media posts and generate insights.

Introduction - 

Canada Post, as a prominent postal service provider, receives a substantial volume of customer feedback through reviews and comments. This project focuses on analyzing this feedback to understand customer sentiments better. We go beyond simple positive/negative sentiment classification and aim to provide deeper insights into customer experiences.

Features - 

•	Sentiment Analysis: Utilize Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to perform sentiment analysis on customer reviews.

•	Comparison with Other Postal Services: We plan to extend our analysis by comparing sentiment analysis results for Canada Post with other postal services, both within Canada and internationally. This cross-comparison can reveal potential areas for improvement and help Canada Post stand out in customer satisfaction.

•	Visualizations: Data visualization plays a crucial role in communicating findings. We intend to create interactive visualizations using tools like Tableau or Power BI to present sentiment trends, service comparisons, and more.

•	Recommendation Engine: Building on sentiment analysis insights, we aspire to develop a recommendation engine that suggests specific improvements Canada Post can make to its services. This could involve clustering similar reviews to identify common themes and generating actionable recommendations based on those themes.

Usage - 

•	Collect and preprocess customer reviews data.

•	Run sentiment analysis scripts to analyze sentiments in the reviews.

•	Explore and visualize sentiment trends and comparisons.

•	Experiment with the recommendation engine to generate service improvement suggestions.

Requirements - 

•	Anaconda Notebook/ Google Colab

•	Microsoft Word, PowerPoint, Excel
