,shota armstrong,1,"If could give it 0 stars I would. Worst experience I‚Äôve had trying to ship something. I got there before about 15 people but received very little help before they dealt with anyone else. Had to reenter shipping info 3 times in the computer before it actually worked. All the info was already on a label I made but I had to make their label for some reason. And for whatever reason the employees couldn‚Äôt do ship it themselves when everything there. Should have taken 2 minutes but it was 30+ minute ordeal. Lady on the phone said that it should take the package 2 days, but when I got to the centre they said 3. The call was placed within 20 minutes of me getting to the centre. Flight leaves Monday night either way so the system they use is not reliable."
,C H,1,"They NEVER tell you when they‚Äôre delivering. I have ALWAYS had to venture somewhere away from home to pick up a package, every single time despite asking to be notified when the package arrives. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry we missed you‚Äù should be their motto."
,Zenah Surani,5,"The individual working on Sunday July 9th during the day was very helpful. I couldn't find my tracking number on my phone and only had my ID. He saw that I was struggling and retrieved my package anway, after asking a few questions. Thanks for being helpful and efficient!"
,Dakkar (Rabanne),1,"I‚Äôm yet to receive a package from Purolator on time. When I buy something online that is expensive and I find out they used Purolator to ship it I become very anxious and worried because on top of delivering my packages late, the driver doesn‚Äôt even bother ringing the bell after they dump the package outside for anyone to steal. Everything became clear and started making sense when I learnt that they are owned by Canada Post. I now call merchants before hand and ask if they have different shipping options, and if they only ship with Purolator then I don‚Äôt buy from them ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
,Jag Gill,4,I've used the Hawthorne location many times and it's always been a pleasant experience. The people who work there are joyful and seem to enjoy being at work. The staff will go above and beyond if they can and it is much appreciated.
,Shannon MacCuaig,1,"I have repeatedly had Purolator truck come to my door with a note saying they missed me - no ring or knock, no package in hand. in other words, no intention of trying to give me my package, and I had to go fetch it at this location. I'm not sure if it's fair to give this location only one star, because I don't know where the driver is from... my direct experience with this location has been good, but they couldn't do anything about the drivers in question when I complained."
,Barbara Houghton,1,"Since Christmas this store/dropoff location no longer gives receipts when you drop off your packages. So, if your parcel is not scanned it will be untrackable thus the customer will have no proof that they dropped off their parcel. The excuse I was given as to why there is NO MORE RECEIPTS, 'the paper is too expensive'.  Really Purolator, I'm sure you can afford it with what you charge or maybe you should ask Canada Post for a paper loan!!!!!!!!!!!!

Vanessa, you obviously did not read the post correctly. I am talking about PROOF OF DROP OFF. Having the shipping label is no good if it is NOT scanned. So here is the scenario: I drop off 2 packages, I leave the store, later on I look in the system for the tracking updates and only see one. Can't find the other. I go back to the store the next day and show the clerk my two tracking numbers but he/she can only find one in the system, but I dropped off two packages, they say 'Sorry Ma'am but we only have the one, are you sure you brought in two packages?'. There has to be a PROOF OF DROP OFF RECEIPT for the Customer before they leave the store. Clerks get busy,  parcels can be put in the wrong place or they think they scanned them but they have not been scanned and are passed through. The parcel should be scanned in front of the Customer and a PROOF OF DROP OFF RECEIPT provided before the Customer leaves the store. Mistakes happen and I know they do, WHY, I have had 25 years in the Postal business, I worked in many departments including the plants, so I know what I'm talking about. I will no longer use Purolator for this reason, I agree you need to cut costs, but cutting a Customer's PROOF and CONFIDENCE is not one of them and definitely not good business practice when the Customer and their merchandise is supposed to be your #1 number one priority."
,Portal,1,"Does anyone know how this company is still in business today? I read the reviews and I'm just surprised because I also met very bad service. I do not know how they delivered my package, but for several weeks the delivery person did not call me even once. If you live in an apartment building, avoid this company. They are incapable of calling people to deliver a package.
Separately, I want to say about the customer service. Generally rude and indifferent people work there. They called me three times, and I explained all three times that the delivery man would call me upon arrival. I would go downstairs and pick it up myself. The driver does not even have to climb to the top floor. But it was all useless. These are irresponsible people who do their job very badly. I requested that my package be returned to the sender and we will use another courier company to send my package.
No more Purolator."
,Cody Vanasse,1,Walk up to your door and don't even knock just put a note on your door and walk away making you go pick it up. It happens all the time so it's not just a certain driver.
,Ranmal Perera,5,"Hi, I'm the guy with the basketball hat!! I went to this Purolator store to return Bell wifi pods. Very quick and excellent service. No hassle what so ever."
,Naa√Ølah Yodoma,1,"The worst experience I ever had with a delivery service.
The day of the delivery (on Monday )I called them to leave my package without signature since I was at work but they said no and I missed the delivery.
I asked to send the package to a pick up location since their main location is really far from the city. They did a ‚Äúsorting error TWICE‚Äú TWO days in a row which mean the driver didn‚Äôt pickup the right package to make the delivery and we are Friday today and since they are closed on the weekend I have to wait until Monday to have my package. (If they don‚Äôt do another sorting error)
I called them to ask for a pickup to their main location since they are incapable of doing the right delivery and I can not spend another weekend without internet but they couldn‚Äôt even prepare my package for a pickup before the closing time.
Because of their mistake I spent the whole week and will spend the weekend without internet and I work from home.
Very disappointing experience."
,lud_genesis (genesis011),1,"Unfriendliest staff I‚Äôve ever met they try to rush you out the door, needs a proof of residence even tho I have the emails confirming my order‚Ä¶ really just a terrible experience all around"
,J L,1,They do not follow proper procedures and drivers will forge signatures with no attempt of knocking on the door to advise of deliveries. Avoid having packages shipped via Purolator at all costs.
,Michelle S,1,"We ordered new phones through Bell, they were delivered late-while my partner was in Kuwait. Despite having filled out SEVERAL ‚Äúno signature needed‚Äù forms over the years (we live  in the woods), I did not have the means of going to pick them. My partner was calling them from Kuwait to see if they could hold onto our phones past the 5 day maximum they attest to on the pickup ticket since he was in the Middle East. He spent 2-3 hours trying to get through to someone only to have someone say they would call him back. They never did. We went today (Tuesday)-closed! Our new phones are‚Ä¶we are not sure where exactly. If I had known Purolator was the courrier, I‚Äôd have stuck with Rogers. TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE AND SERVICE. How are these guys still in business?"
,Guy Lachance,1,I was home but they just didn't attempt to deliver even if it says they did then they declared as having an invalid adresse. The same address intelcom delivered to... Called and chatted customer service 3 times for pickup. Tracking still hasn't updated. Now I have to wait if it will show up ready for pickup anywhere. It's like a slow  package hostage service now.
,saeed ghoddous,5,"Impressive customer support by Zach. Although his shift was almost over, he stayed to help me ship my items. He‚Äôs the best."
,Kerry Wilson,2,This is drop off mostly. There really isn‚Äôt anyone there to help you if you have a question/concern. It gives the impression that the Home Hardware this desk is located within really doesn‚Äôt care that much about the business.
,Boris Shpungin,1,"Came today to this Purolator location to drop off prepaid package. Staff in very rude form refused to accept the package and provide receipt. Try to avoid this establishment and do not waste your time to come here.
Terrible service!"
,Michael,1,"Purolator is by far the worst courier service. Unless you absolutely need to use their services, you will be better off looking elsewhere. Their couriers never bother delivering: they have a simple KPI to visit the address, but the sooner they leave, the sooner they can finish their job. So, if they need to get your signature and you live in an apartment building - bad luck, the courier won't waste their precious time waiting for you to go downstairs, they will just leave a sticker and make you do their job for them next day. Their customer support won't bother helping you."
,Eric L,3,All the way in the back. Isle are freaking small
,Jennifer Turley,1,Horrible service. Each time I go in I‚Äôm completely ignored by staff. No tracking receipt given. They want you just to leave package on counter where anyone can take it. Several time my packages have not been delivered. Lost or stolen I suspect.
,Robbie Creswell,5,
,Tania Lavergne,4,
,Noha Omar,5,
,Shreedhar Bhat,3,"Had to drive 30km each side to collect my courier because they dropped in during office hours. Upon requesting to re delivery I was told we cannot getting an estimated time as to when they can try to redeliver. 9- 5 is a pretty wide window to be waiting. When you‚Äôre working . Also, pickup available on Saturdays but no delivery. Disappointed!
3 stars because the customer service (on call) was apologetic and provided the best option she could at the time . Please improve your delivery methods . Hoping to come back and give a better rating if improvement are seenüôÇ.
PS not going to respond to system generated responses that I have been reading in the commentsüòä"
,Chris Salazar,1,"Received door knocker that my parcel would be ready for p/u at 7pm. Showed up at 710 to no avail. Hung around till 755pm to try again to no avail. Received a text from purolator at 758 stating that my parcel was ready for p/u. I don't normally write reviews good, bad or indifferent but I need to call out a business when they drop the bsll this hard. Super frustrating given that I drove 20mins from home to grab what I needed for work. Crummy service. Second time sound. I will go out of my way to pay extra to avoid this service."
,Adam Smith,1,"Only delivery service that refuses to deliver to my apartment. They don't even leave the delivery slip in a private area, just slap it on the lobby door. Always have to pickup from their wildly out of the way shipping hub. I now cancel any orders that attempt to ship through them since I'll just have to drive out and pick them up anyways."
,Robin G,1,"Delivered my package to a random address in Barrie even with the right address from my end and rogers. No communication while I‚Äôm currently being billed from rogers however after calling rogers and dealing with them they helped me out great and got me a new modem, however I know they still do not have their other modem that some random person signed for (wasn‚Äôt me) and ended up at some random address, I strongly suggest using Amazon or UPS even Canada post has better customer service and actually answer you. Severely disappointed. Will never use Purolator again if I can help it. This is not the first time this has happened from the company as a whole."
,Naomi Ann,1,The delivery guy did not try to contact me  what do ever to deliver my package. But still continued to say I was not there yet I was. I went to pick my package up at the warehouse and they told me it was not there. Not the first time I‚Äôve had problems they are the WORST. Definitely won‚Äôt be using again.
,piyush sawani,1,"Its difficult to find where the drop box is.
I was about to leave but then i thought lets check the back of the building.
No directions, nothing.
I just dropped my parcel there
and
there are so many big parcels in there i am afraid now what if someone steals it.
Tho‚Äô I made sure that my car can be seen in camera just for any problem i receive in my dropoff or anything goes missing."
,Matias Contreras,1,"I was expecting my package to arrive on Oct 19. I got 2 notifications indicating that there were several failed delivery attempts, but I work from home and there are other 3 people living in the same house. Definitely, there was no one even trying to deliver the package. I requested to know a pickup location to go by myself, but this is the 3rd time that nobody gives me that info and the package keeps going again for ""delivery"". It has been 3 days without being able to pick up my item and with nobody showing up at my place. The driver did not even bother leaving a delivery notice, so I have no clues on what's happening. Lastly, the customer service representatives (Susan and Brennan) did not even pay attention to my situation and just copied/pasted template answers indicating that nobody answered the door when the driver arrived these 2 times.

Definitely a terrible service."
,Ashley Pugh,3,"I had an issue and it was resolved 2 weeks after dropping off my package. While I‚Äôm glad it was resolved, I think Purolator need to look into the following issues:
When I dropped my package off the opening to the drop box allowed me to see other peoples packages. This could easily lead to theft of any package inside.
My package didn‚Äôt show up as scanned anywhere and I didn‚Äôt know if it had made it to its destination until today, two weeks later. It was an Amazon return and I was monitoring the return page on the Amazon app. Maybe if I had looked at the tracking number on the Putolator website it would have showed me the status there. So that‚Äôs my fault for not checking both websites.

I am glad my package return was successful though."
,Haylan Riley,5,It's a dropbox for mail. Could be more accessible..
,Saumya Shah (Sam),1,It‚Äôs been 10 business days and none of the 4 pre paid shipments been picked up or as per tracking number. I wonder if it will ever be on track ! Or were they stolen  from the overfilled drop box ?
,Abubakr Mossa,1,"If it happened that you are expecting a shipment with this company, you need to sit at your doorstep without blinking to catch your shipment. I wrote this review only after missing many deliveries without a real attempt to deliver. So everytime I buy a product and it says that Purolator will deliver, I expect missing the delivery date. They really need to improve their delivery protocol and spend few more ""seconds"" to ""attempt the delivery""."
,Jigar Maheshwari,5,Purolator has big space for Loading and unloading Courier and Delivery products for various companies.  Working culture is really good here and hiring also frequent. Good Parking Area. Greeneries. Near to Bombardier and Domestic Airport of Montreal. However no such food stores available nearby. You have to go bit far to get some good food.
,David,5,Easy pick up and drop off location. Big parking lot. Bus stop right in front. Safe walking entrance. Hand sanitizer at the entrance. Counters to write and prepare pakages. Computer and printer available for clients. Small battery recycling box at this location.
,Shweta Suryavanshi,5,"Good location, huge facility and staff is helpful. Lot of parking spots available. Quick response by workers and they have knowledge about all available services."
,Betty Gagnon,1,"I order something refrigerated, it is clearly indicated everywhere!!!!! But they dont bother to keep it refrigerated. On top of all, they had a delay in the transit and delivery, so everything is lost."
,Z C,1,"After reading all of these reviews, I can see that I am not the only one experiencing delivery issues! Good job Purolator, this company never changes. Despite being home all the time, the courier claimed that receiver was unavailable to receive the package. I even rearranged my schedule to ensure that I would be available, but the package was sent to the Purolator office again. However, sometimes we do not have control over which courier service is used for our deliveries. I will give my feedback to the seller for sure"
,Sebastien Prosper,5,"My second time at this store and I have gotten great service twice. The lady behind the desk was efficient and willing to help. She has short hair, red and black. Thank you for your help in getting my packages sent out."
,Mary Blume,1,"If I could give 0 stars I would. This is the worst delivery experience of my life. The first delivery attempt they claimed they didn't have my unit number and refused delivery. I checked the address, and resubmitted. I left instructions in their page as requested on how to deliver, as I live in an apartment building without a doorman. Second time they claim I was not home, uh did not follow my instructions, or attempt to contact me. They tell me to go pick my stuff up here. Fine. The woman at the counter was so rude, the worst customer service I've EVER received. I showed her my tracking number, my ID and my lease since they require legal proof of address. She REFUSED to give me my package since there was ""handwriting"" on my lease aka my signatures. This policy is beyond ridiculous, she refused to give me my package unless I showed her my CREDIT CARD STATEMENT OR BANK INFORMATION. I refused, that is beyond private information I'm not showing to a random person at the post office. She said if I didn't my only option was to set up redelivery. Fine. I stayed home from work today and now I get a notification that ""we attempted delivery but you weren't home"" I HAVE BEEN HOME ALL DAY. I LITERALLY FEEL LIKE MY PACKAGE IS BEING HELD HOSTAGE. JUST DELIVER MY THINGS ITS NOT HARD! I have been on hold with your customer service for over an hour now. If I ever see Purolator as the shipper again I'm cancelling my order and buying things elsewhere. Horrible company"
,Marc Lavoie,1,"Picking up there was ok. The reason I had to drive 4 hours round trip to help my daughter to pick up a package there because they could not complete their delivery, even though she took 2 days off to be home when they told her they would delivered ... not so pleased. It was a large package, an exercise bike, and I would wager their contractors either didn't have the equipment to move the thing safely or they just couldn't be bothered."
,Marcus Saldanha,1,Service was not the best. If you read Mary Blumes review it sums up the same issues I was having. The lady working the day I went was giving me attitude on top of it.
,Kristina Amja,1,Very bad service. Did not help me at all. I have a return package from Purolator that is prepaid which offers the packing services but she refused to find a solution and package my item. I strongly don‚Äôt suggest them.
,ofelia Sanchez Fernandez,5,"for the last 4 year our company Buffalo David Bitton having operatios with Purolator, i should say all these years we have experienced a very well organised and punctual services from Purolator. i should mention the name, Gabriel who has been maintaining extraordinary services as representative of Purolator. no delays, not even a missing had occured by his side. i really appreciate Purolator for having such employees. In future also we seek these well maintained service"
,Aminata,1,"These people NEVER do their job right. How can you deliver a package without even knocking at the door ???? They leave notices with the wrong date and adress, and then when you call customer care they make promises they can stick to. I don‚Äôt even know why companies bother working with them‚Ä¶.. They are the woooooorssssst."
,Nathan Locke,1,"Zero accountability

Horrible service. Got a notification to pick up a package, when i get there im told it was for someone else and they already picked up. Meanwhile nobody knows where my computer screen is, i wasted hours of my saturday, and they couldn't even register a complaint, they refer to the website. Worst service ever"
,Patrick Modafferi,1,"The note left had the wrong date and time on it, wrong operating hours. Writing was not readable. Driver showed up at a random time not listed on the tracking info...
As if that wasn't bad enough, they gave my package to someone they 'claimed' had my ID (hard to believe) and refused to help in any way, just sent me to go to the police. Very suspicious, would not use this location under any circumstances."
,Mario Wu,1,"Terrible service.
shipped an package with them to a customer in Kingston.
Item tk showed delivered, but it was no where to be found.
Called, for a trace of the package.
They replied. It was delievered to the right address, see proof on the Tracking number. There is nothing we can do, your lost.

WHAT? a shipping company without a valid proof, and tells you are out of luck. no photos... they are not amazon, just their words. we delivered, if not there. your fault for not asking for signature.

A joke"
,Radha Canada,1,"Their customer service is a joke. They probably answer our calls, make a note of our complaint and make paper boats with them. The best thing they can do is of course, Closing. If not, they should close their customer service department."
,E J,1,"Suppose to get a second delivery yesterday. First delivery, I instructed the driver to drop it in the mail room. He said no, he has to give it hand to hand. Strange since I have been receiving AmazonSomeone will be calling be back. 3 days later no call. I called the sender who follow up with them and they were supposed to deliver 24 hours later. Tracking the package, it says ready for pick up in Ville St-Pierre 30-45 minutes from where I live. Now, spending a lot of time on the phone to have someone to ship at least to an office close to where I live. I am wishing myself good luck!"
,jesus varela,1,They never follow instructions deliveries are always in bad shape can't recommend them seriously is a joke
,J X,1,"I also have been having my share of bad services such as no delivery attempts, no updates on the tracking info and where they put something up it‚Äôs some unbelievable excuses like unable to delivery due to road closure.
Everyone affected by their bad service has the right to request for their package to be returned to the sender. That‚Äôs the only way they will really answer to us because they will have to reimburse for the delivery fees. Then ask the sender to use a more competent delivery company."
,Anne Erta,2,"Oh boy!, this Purolator is very complicated. It seems like they will give a hard time for the receiver. I went to their place twice and not very helpful . I almost return the items to the company's and tell them never never use Purolator. üôÉ  I am very disappointed üòû until now the parcel they put on the locker and I have to call the company about this.  Very complicated. The agent who answered the phone not very helpful too . üôÑ  if there is ZERO  rate I will give zero(0)  name your company DELAYED !!!!"
,Shengyue He,1,"""Speechless in awe...""

That was my original post. Within an hour, the owner responded with the text down below.

OK. Bear with me.

To be fair this particular depot is decent, wait time, staff, etc., no worse than any other similar services (pick-up depot). However, since all undelivered parcels are routed here, it becomes a natural target of frustration from dealing with Purolator, all these years.

That promoted a overreaching question: why the delivery success rate is so low compared to other shippers? Why someone was clearly at home then but never was a ring bell heard? Did the driver even tried? Was that the company's policy just to dump everything to the depot instead?

Especially when this depot is not specially easy to reach.

My last shipment was delivered sort-of on schedule. But the one before was a total disaster. Ironically, it was actually delivered, only days after a loss investigation was started. Apparently the truck driver made a false claim that the parcel was delivered to the correct address on time, which then caused me, the seller and Purolator hours to fix.

I asked the seller ""why do you guys engage Purolator"". She couldn't answer."
,Dinesh Kumar,1,"If it were possible, I would give this experience zero stars. After receiving a message stating that the delivery attempt had failed, I was instructed to search for the delivery notice. However, I did not receive any buzzer call or phone call, nor did I find any delivery notice. It is astonishing to me that they could overlook a delivery that may be important and time-sensitive with such ease."
,Louiza Z.,1,"IF I COULD PUT 0 I WILL PUT 0

Attempted delivery Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday. I was home all days waiting for my package.

Tuesday, when the fake ""attempted delivery was made "" I requested that I will go and collect the package since I will have more chances to get it.

GUESS WHAT?
Wednesday, I received a message telling me that my package is on its way.

GUESS WHAT?
Another ""fake delivery"" attempt??

And today which is Friday.
GUESS WHAT  another failed attempt.

SHAME ON YOU PUROLATOR!

I am not the only one with this experience and yet I see no improvement!"
,yaya,1,"AVOID AT ALL COST!!!!!!!! My friend ordered the new Zelda game for me and even paid for express shipping so I could receive it on my birthday and have a good time. Around 6pm, he tells me that they put ‚Äúattempted delivery‚Äù when they did not pass at all!!! We were home all day!!! There was no attempt at all! And their location is in the middle of nowhere that is barely accessible by transit, let alone foot. It cost me 50$ of uber to go back and forth. Not only do their delivery workers not even bother attempting the delivery but they default it to a location that is complicated to get to! My friend wasted money on express shipping and I ended up having to pay for a game that was meant to be a gift. Awful company and management."
,Rodolfo Delperras,1,"The worst company ever do not work with them and do not try the fast delivery they are just lier and also their customer service is the worst I have ever seen . They don‚Äôt try to help but do what they want to do from their head . Everyone should avoid their service even if you have to move to New York go by yourself and don‚Äôt wait in any city in Canada because they are the worst ever.
Please guys read all the comment in this page most of the customer are giving 1 and they should remove this company from the market as she is really disrespectful to people and they don‚Äôt care about you or what you think !!! Shame on them and on their ceo or director that only sleep instead of honoring customer.
Please contact me so we can sue them to the court thank you"
,Val Michailov,1,"Ignorent, disrespectful, irresponsible people.
If Purolator ships your package there‚Äôs 100% certainty you have to run for it. On over 10+ deliveries i had a misfortune to deal with Purolator non was delivered, never did the driver give a call, knock on the door, leave a notice! And I live in Downtown Montreal in a multi storey building, there‚Äôs literally not a single option to miss a delivery. But these guys do it (on purpose?) out of their lack of training(?), company values(?). Such recklessness can be a coincidence a few times, but with the consistency Purolator fails to fulfil its obligations, its management keeps proving that their clients‚Äô comfort is their least priority. What I recommend to every customer, when placing orders with merchants specifically ask that the delivery be made through anyone other then Purolator. This works with BestBuy, Amazon, Bell if you specifically ask for this during checkout."
,Nathan,1,"(This review is for Expert Shipping, not Purolator, although the return carrier is Purolator). I returned an amazon package. The guy was very busy (there was a line up) and said to just ¬´¬†leave it¬†¬ª . I figured I would trust the guy, because he was so busy, and Ive been his shoes before‚Ä¶ Big mistake.. still havent gotten the refund and it has been 2 weeks. I guess the guy just kept the package to himself."
,Oli ver,1,"Always late! Sometimes they just dont do their job... When you are supposed to receive a package requiring a signature, they leave the package in front of your door without notification."
,Alexandre Willame,1,"They use illegal charge practises, they take zero responsibility if they damage or loose any of your packages, they are rude to clients and very unprofessional, avoid this place and go to the DHL store next to Beaubien metro (or the one next to McGill metro downtown), or the UPS Store next to Sherbrook metro as an alternative.

They make you pay for package drops even if the shipping are already paid. I used to drop packages there and they never charged me before, the girl told me they will charge me 5$ per package, when I asked her to show me where this rule is, she told me to check the website. After I found nothing on the website and asked her to show me where it was, she was first very rude and would not explain why she chose to charge me now but never did in the past. She then called her manager, and after a while, told me that her manager told her it was 5$ per package (so the rule was nowhere to be found on the website). After giving up per lost of time, I end up agreeing to a proposal she made (5$ for the lot of 6 packages). When it is time to pay, she charged me 23$, saying it's a favor because it should be more, totally ignoring she told me it would be 5$ before handling the packages. I ended up having to accept the surcharge by lack of time as it was closing time.

Also, when I got back home, I realized they wrote on the receipt they were not responsible for any loss or damage of the package they handle, basically giving them a free pass to do whatever they want with your package if they don't like your face or whatever. I would have never agreed to leave my valuable packages if I would have knew of that beforehand, and certainly not after having paid a surcharge for them to take care of the packages."
,Linda Morin,3,I had an excellent experience today with the person at the counter however I gave 3 stars because I received an email yesterday stating that the delivery could not be made because nobody was home which is false. I work from home and we have a 24/7 receptionist that signs for packages. If you are sick or in an accident I totally understand but lying is a different story. I had to rent a car to pick up the package. This is not the first time this has happened.
,Marie-Claude Breton,2,"I was waiting for a delivery today. I had registered for ‚ÄúAvoid missed deliveries.
Track your package with SMS notifications‚Äù even though I new I‚Äôd be home all day. Doorbell never rang nor did I receive an SMS. Thought I‚Äôd check the delivery status at 3:30‚Ä¶ What do I see: 	Delayed in transit due to missed connection at 8:00 AM and at 3:22 PM. Meanwhile, I‚Äôve been home all day waiting for my package.
Chatted with the AI which was useless, called the toll free to get the AI again and, asked to speak to a human person to see if I could pick up my parcel at the Purolator Centre instead of waiting for another delivery attempt on Monday. Wait is over 45 minutes so I hung up.
Hopefully, they will deliver on Monday. I will be home waiting!!
Side note: I see many negative comments about their opening hours. I think 7:00 AM to 8:30 PM on week days are very decent hours."
,Gurl Gates,1,"Doesn't ask if you want your package left at doorstep. Ruins the effect of ordering a preorder. Cant read the delivery notice because the handwriting is horrible. The open hours are horrible, i wont be able to pick up my package. Had I known, i would've never ordered from a company that ships with purolator. 0/10. The AI is also useless."
,MAISON DES VALISES,1,"I am asking all companies please stop make Delvery with this courier. I received call from my buzzer and I opened the door downstairs,he said I have Delvery. And I told him it is on 8th floor. Beside that I went to down and I saw he puts note for pick up. Such worst ever experience. It is happened 3 times with this garbage courier company no respect at all."
,Alexandr Constantinov,1,"Never again!!!!!! Correct address, correct telephone number and present at home, he passes by and then indicates on the tracking of the package ‚ÄúRecipient inaccessible‚Äù."
,Nerella Collot,1,Not open 24 hrs. Better off going to Bureau en gros.

,Keven Cl√©ment,1,If I could leave a 0 i could!! They left my package ( 340$) on the side walk in front my app... The note said: i work from home call me. They didnt. They do not care about customer they care about money. Worst delivery ever ill ask for a refund on amazonr every time i see its them
,ronald arsenault,1,"Terrible service. there was someone at delivery site (residential). The door belle never rang. They left a sticker on the door. I went to pick up, showed driver's license (My name different address), email with invoice and tracking number for my purchase, the notice left at the door. They would not give me my package as the address on my license was different that the delivery site.

You can only ship to your address on your drivers license?"
,Chia Fan Hsu,1,"The worst experience ever. I order through Amazon. The first time they tried to deliver I was not home, and the message showed that they will try to deliver again but it didn't happen. I contact Amezone the same day, and they said they are going to deliver the next day but it never happen! I waited the whole day but no phone call, no email, no text message. It was the product I need it for an important event, now I have nothing."
,Incineroar,1,"We were at home until noon with 2 dogs who always bark when the doorbell rings. The doorbell did not ring once, and we left around 12.05 after checking the mail to see no delivery slip. After returning home after 3pm, we returned home to a delivery slip dated for for 11.26. And now I have to go out in the middle of a heatwave to go get important legal documents I need to go across the whole danged island to deal with my recently deceased father's estate.

This isn't the first time they have messed up my delivery, but this is easily the most stressful time they've done this. I have been dealing with estate issues for over a year, and when it's finally over, I have to go dig through my RECENTLY DECEASED FATHER'S paperwork looking for everything I need all over again.

Horrible, horrible experience."
,abe hirrino,1,"I ordered something on Amazon. I was supposed to receive it the next day. I didn‚Äôt receive the item. I called Purolator No answer. I checked with Amazon they told its lost. Two day later I received a call from Purolator telling me to come pick up the item on ville d‚ÄôAnjou. I asked the person to deliver the item to my work. They said okay. The next days I received another call informing me that it will cost me 38$ if I change the address, they said but it‚Äôs free of charge if you pick it up from a store on Saint Laurent street, fine.
I went to the store the tracking number doesn‚Äôt exist on their computer. I think the delivery guy didn‚Äôt even bother to do his job."
,Evelyn Kraneck,1,"I have never had a good experience with Purolator, but the last time they were even worst. So they didn‚Äôt left any notice that they have tried to deliver my package at my address, later consulting my tracking number I figured that they‚Äôd sent my package for counter pick up at their distribution center (remember no notice at my address how should I guess) and after 5 days sent back my package to sender. It is just a headache to work with them! Do not recommend."
,Mostapha El Shafey,1,"Extremely unprofessional company, and customer service always shifts the blame to the driver, they always just claim that they don't know why the driver didn't deliver the package. How convenient for them. They never actually attempt delivery (confirmed), and after a few days they just tell you to come pick up your package from their warehouse two hours away. I'm starting to think this company is just a scam? They take your money for a delivery service, then they tell you to go pick up your package yourself. Unbelievable how they are still in business."

,Abram Sez,1,"I have never successfully received a package from purolator on the first attempt, even though I am almost always home when the delivery slip is left.

A week later I get a notice saying the package had been delivered, although, no delivery, no signature. 2 hrs later I noticed online an ""Attention"" alert, saying that I have to go pick it up at their depot.

,Billy Joe Aggabao,1,Delivery guy Dialed in for a delivery but did not really go inside for delivery. I work from home so the guy did not really want to deliver the package. Instead left a note. Vaudreuil dorion area! Get a better delivery driver.
,Nicolas Bouchard Coombs,2,"I am current at four out of four deliveries from Purolator where the driver never bothered to attempt a delivery (one of these was after a fresh snowfall and there were no tracks anywhere!). The driver, four times out of four, did not leave a note. I would not recommend Purolator to anyone. I have not encountered this with Amazon, FedEx, Intelcom, UPS, or Canada Post (despite both Canada Post and Purolator, last I checked, being managed by the same parent company); they all have always at least made a token effort at delivering the parcel they have.

The depot is pretty out of the way, and I see that the hours were changed such that it is not even open 12-4. So now not only is it a pain to receive the parcels in the first place, but picking them up at the depot is more of a pain than it already was before.

I give two stars rather than one only because I have not had problems with the employees at the pickup counter once there. I could see in their faces that I was far from the first who had voiced my complaints to them about the drivers."
,France Miron,1,"Waited all day for an urgent package to arrive. At 3pm decided to check the status online and saw ""Attempted delivery - receiver unavailable"". I'm working from home!! They definitively didn't come at all. Worst thing is says to check my notice. Well there isn't any obviously. This is so frustration. Get better drivers that will actually do their job in the Vaudreuil-Dorion area. This is not the first time this has happened. Now I don't know how to get my urgent package."
,Barry McGarr,1,"Worst service. Had next day delivery and at 1pm tracker said it was out for delivery by 8:30pm still a no show so I called and they said it would be tomorrow or day after. When I asked why they tried to blame sender (but it was on the truck at 1pm) and on top of that they tried and went back in tracker system and chaned status of delivery to delayed at 5:30 but I called the at 8:30 and at that time tracking still said out for delivery. They lied and are sketchy, customer service dont care. Don't trust them with important package that need to be on time."
,Kromad Inc.,1,"Worst delivery company. Worst customer service. I'd advise anyone to find any other carrier service available before selecting Purolator. Why is there no zero star option? Even a star is too much for them. I've never been this angry with any other company in my 30 years of existence. Leaving the country now for the winter and ordered a package with 30$ overnight delivery, yet Purolator, no matter how much you pay for shipping, cannot make it happen. It's been 4 days of waiting for my package that I will never end up receiving. And lost money on top of it. Called customer service, used the Live Chat option, did what I had to do and they're only response is ""I'm sorry you feel this way"". Avoid at all cost."

5cm of snow the other day = ‚Äúweather delay‚Äù

Basically if driver doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúfeel‚Äù like carrying boxes, you won‚Äôt get your delivery, if they see their might be stairs and a box that weighs more than 20lbs you won‚Äôt get your delivery.

They did everything to excuse themselves not to deliver. Bruh."

,Hajira Syed,1,"Avoid shipping with Purolator at all costs. I understand shipping delays but when there is no update on your tracking number in 4 days and customer service can't tell you when your package will be delivered thats just bad service. They know exactly where my package is but wont let me go pick it up. They aren't the only ones running a business, ruining client relationships when their service cant deliver on time. Paying the extra money is 100% worth it UPS is a very close in price and sometimes even cheaper with way better service."

I got there before about 15 people but received very little help before they dealt with anyone else. Had to reenter shipping info 3 times in the computer before it actually worked. All the info was already on a label I made but I had to make their label for some reason. And for whatever reason the employees couldn‚Äôt do ship it themselves when everything there. Should have taken 2 minutes but it was 30+ minute ordeal. Lady on the phone said that it should take the package 2 days, but when I got to the centre they said 3. The call was placed within 20 minutes of me getting to the centre. Flight leaves Monday night either way so the system they use is not reliable."

Everything became clear and started making sense when I learnt that they are owned by Canada Post.

I'm not sure if it's fair to give this location only one star, because I don't know where the driver is from... my direct experience with this location has been good, but they couldn't do anything about the drivers in question when I complained."
,Barbara Houghton,1,"Since Christmas this store/dropoff location no longer gives receipts when you drop off your packages. So, if your parcel is not scanned it will be untrackable thus the customer will have no proof that they dropped off their parcel. The excuse I was given as to why there is NO MORE RECEIPTS, 'the paper is too expensive'.  Really Purolator, I'm sure you can afford it with what you charge or maybe you should ask Canada Post for a paper loan!!!!!!!!!!!!

Vanessa, you obviously did not read the post correctly. I am talking about PROOF OF DROP OFF. Having the shipping label is no good if it is NOT scanned. So here is the scenario: I drop off 2 packages, I leave the store, later on I look in the system for the tracking updates and only see one. Can't find the other. I go back to the store the next day and show the clerk my two tracking numbers but he/she can only find one in the system, but I dropped off two packages, they say 'Sorry Ma'am but we only have the one, are you sure you brought in two packages?'. There has to be a PROOF OF DROP OFF RECEIPT for the Customer before they leave the store. Clerks get busy,  parcels can be put in the wrong place or they think they scanned them but they have not been scanned and are passed through. The parcel should be scanned in front of the Customer and a PROOF OF DROP OFF RECEIPT provided before the Customer leaves the store. Mistakes happen and I know they do, WHY, I have had 25 years in the Postal business, I worked in many departments including the plants, so I know what I'm talking about. I will no longer use Purolator for this reason, I agree you need to cut costs, but cutting a Customer's PROOF and CONFIDENCE is not one of them and definitely not good business practice when the Customer and their merchandise is supposed to be your #1 number one priority."
,Portal,1,"Does anyone know how this company is still in business today? I read the reviews and I'm just surprised because I also met very bad service. I do not know how they delivered my package, but for several weeks the delivery person did not call me even once. If you live in an apartment building, avoid this company. They are incapable of calling people to deliver a package.
Separately, I want to say about the customer service. Generally rude and indifferent people work there. They called me three times, and I explained all three times that the delivery man would call me upon arrival. I would go downstairs and pick it up myself. The driver does not even have to climb to the top floor. But it was all useless. These are irresponsible people who do their job very badly. I requested that my package be returned to the sender and we will use another courier company to send my package.
No more Purolator."

,Naa√Ølah Yodoma,1,"The worst experience I ever had with a delivery service.
The day of the delivery (on Monday )I called them to leave my package without signature since I was at work but they said no and I missed the delivery.
I asked to send the package to a pick up location since their main location is really far from the city. They did a ‚Äúsorting error TWICE‚Äú TWO days in a row which mean the driver didn‚Äôt pickup the right package to make the delivery and we are Friday today and since they are closed on the weekend I have to wait until Monday to have my package. (If they don‚Äôt do another sorting error)
I called them to ask for a pickup to their main location since they are incapable of doing the right delivery and I can not spend another weekend without internet but they couldn‚Äôt even prepare my package for a pickup before the closing time.
Because of their mistake I spent the whole week and will spend the weekend without internet and I work from home.

Despite having filled out SEVERAL ‚Äúno signature needed‚Äù forms over the years (we live  in the woods), I did not have the means of going to pick them. My partner was calling them from Kuwait to see if they could hold onto our phones past the 5 day maximum they attest to on the pickup ticket since he was in the Middle East. He spent 2-3 hours trying to get through to someone only to have someone say they would call him back. They never did. We went today (Tuesday)-closed! Our new phones are‚Ä¶we are not sure where exactly. If I had known Purolator was the courrier, I‚Äôd have stuck with Rogers. TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE AND SERVICE. How are these guys still in business?"
,Guy Lachance,1,I was home but they just didn't attempt to deliver even if it says they did then they declared as having an invalid adresse. The same address intelcom delivered to...

,Michael,1,"Purolator is by far the worst courier service. Unless you absolutely need to use their services, you will be better off looking elsewhere. Their couriers never bother delivering: they have a simple KPI to visit the address, but the sooner they leave, the sooner they can finish their job. So, if they need to get your signature and you live in an apartment building - bad luck, the courier won't waste their precious time waiting for you to go downstairs, they will just leave a sticker and make you do their job for them next day. Their customer support won't bother helping you."

,B L,1,"The delivery person for 2077 Pembina is fraudulently reporting that they have attempted delivery. They do not attempt delivery, so do not leave a notice for the customer at our doors. The package is then returned to the sender, and we have to start our orders all over again. FRAUD. They have held urgent materials hostage due to the laziness of their drivers!

You cannot phone 2077 Pembina. They hide their number so they don't have to deal with all the problems their drivers cause. You have to call the 1800, where you just get the annoying recorded voice that sends you in vicious circles. Use Fedex.

UPDATE: oh boy. Now customer service tells me I have a package at the depot. It arrived today. But Delivery Guy was too lazy yet again to buzz me or leave a delivery note. I had to go down there. This genius is probably spending his day in Starbucks or at home watching TV, then just dumping all the packages at the depot.

FURTHER UPDATE: the bank at the other end unfortunately used Purolator again. For the 4th time in a week, they did not attempt delivery, and have not contacted me.

USE FEDEX."

,Onyi Zubby,1,"0 star. Most terrible experience I have ever had from a delivery company! Hopefully all other companies that use them to deliver packages disregard this delivery service and use their competitors to avoid putting their valuable customers in horrible experiences and stressful conditions.

Two items was sent out to me from ON to WPG through purolator! I Was supposed to receive both packages on Thursday! Both item came with two different tracking numbers. Per the tracking one was sent out on Thursday waited all day but no delivery was attempted but was updated on the tracking info online that the delivery driver Attempted delivery - receiver unavailable. And we should come to pick up. No delivery notice was left, I was notified by the online tracking. Whereas the second order was been delivered the next day (today, Friday), same story as the first order-  Attempted delivery - receiver unavailable. While I was sitting at the lobby and waiting for the package whole day, NO ONE SHOWED UP!!!  SERIOUSLY??? NO phone call, no buzzer/doorbell ring. I called customer service on phone and to get a hold of them is another task, long wait times greater than 45min before you get through to an agent.
Now I have to drive for 50min for pickup on Monday as they are closed weekends, waste of my time and money for gas in this trying times and weather. All this which could have been avoided if the delivery driver are doing their job professionally and diligently.

If the delivery drivers are sure they are doing their job correctly and are not been so lackadaisical on their job/duties then they should be handing out delivery notices for failed attempts.

This is reoccurring with other customers as well so Purolator should look into this and do something about it ASAP!"

,Kim Einfeld,1,Please review the hours you have listed. This page says 10 pm. The store is closed at nine.pm What a waste of time.
,Monsieur Martin,2,Printer not working. No way to scan and print the label.
,Darryl Field,5,Works great!
,Zuz Zuz,5,Awesome service
,Navneet Garcha,1,I am really upset with your service. This is my 2nd time. I did not get my delivery and no one came at my building and no one used the buzzer code. They rescheduled my delivery. I don‚Äôt understand if they did not showed up then how they rescheduled.
,B,1,"Shipment was delayed, no updates provided. Just sat in their sorting facility. Had to have it rerouted to a pickup location. Added more delay to pick up my item. Paid an extra 20$ for expedited shipping. Avoid at all costs"
,Daniel Esguerra,1,"Terrible Company. The fact that Amazon even does business with Purolator is baffling. I ordered a tv last week Wednesday with Amazon Prime 2-day delivery and today is Friday a week later and I still haven't received my package. This company is very lazy and doesn't care about their customers. Not one other delivery service has ever let me down. If I could give them negative stars, I would."
,Spooky Mulder,1,"Package said it would arrive for sure last Friday, of course it didn't. Then it said it would arrive Monday , of course it didn't. Monday night after scanning it into the sorting facility 3 times for whatever reason they finally say oh it's 70 pounds so we need to arrange special delivery . They said they would contact us to setup a special delivery time, of course they didn't.  My wife phoned finally Tuesday morning after not getting the call they said they would give us. So they say we will phone you back in yet another 24-48 hours to setup delivery which will probably be several more days. I should have just went to the store and bought a desk. If you have a choice use any other delivery company. If you can get the item in the store just do it . Purolator will not get you your package when its promised by and they will make little to no effort to get you your stuff in a timely manner, avoid at all costs."
,rajvinder kaur brar,1,Such a bad service.Even one star is too much for them . I paid for express service nd even ask them to hold my package because it‚Äôs my important documents. .when I call them they told me they are going to deliver my home because my request is not their system. They don‚Äôt have their drivers phone number or other things so someone in emergency can reach them .just sit home and wait for their super slow services that suppose to be expresse
,Tarnvir UPPAL,5,Go through the back of building go inside and box is right there
,Harshdeep Singh,1,There is no dropbox.
,A N,1,Didnt find it there
,Yuchi C,5,
,Johan Jaimes,1,I was there looking for the Purolator Drop Box but could not find it. I looked for it inside the 444 building at level 1 and around it and it was not there. Maybe it is not there anymore. I had to go to 330 Portage Av.
,Paracide,1,"I look for a long time, but I can't find the drop box"
,Brenda Kwiatkowski,5,"So easy, fast and friendly staff. They certainly know what they are doing.
Very efficient."
,Lawrence Blo,4,
,Darlene Berry,5,Handed my package to friendly Michael's staff at front cash register :)
,D Day,1,Can‚Äôt find the drop box?! Another person was here and he couldn‚Äôt find it neither.

,Onyi Zubby,1,"0 star. Most terrible experience I have ever had from a delivery company! Hopefully all other companies that use them to deliver packages disregard this delivery service and use their competitors to avoid putting their valuable customers in horrible experiences and stressful conditions.

Two items was sent out to me from ON to WPG through purolator! I Was supposed to receive both packages on Thursday! Both item came with two different tracking numbers. Per the tracking one was sent out on Thursday waited all day but no delivery was attempted but was updated on the tracking info online that the delivery driver Attempted delivery - receiver unavailable. And we should come to pick up. No delivery notice was left, I was notified by the online tracking. Whereas the second order was been delivered the next day (today, Friday), same story as the first order- Attempted delivery - receiver unavailable. While I was sitting at the lobby and waiting for the package whole day, NO ONE SHOWED UP!!! SERIOUSLY??? NO phone call, no buzzer/doorbell ring. I called customer service on phone and to get a hold of them is another task, long wait times greater than 45min before you get through to an agent.
Now I have to drive for 50min for pickup on Monday as they are closed weekends, waste of my time and money for gas in this trying times and weather. All this which could have been avoided if the delivery driver are doing their job professionally and diligently.

If the delivery drivers are sure they are doing their job correctly and are not been so lackadaisical on their job/duties then they should be handing out delivery notices for failed attempts.

This is reoccurring with other customers as well so Purolator should look into this and do something about it ASAP!"
,Chris Harp,5,Simply drop and go
,John Spacek,2,"Doesn't handle parcels (they were piled on top of letter drop box) and open to public, so Amazon returns left at own risk!"
,Kelly Morrisseau,1,Cannot find this drop box anywhere. I looked on each floor of this address. No signs to direct
,dj rahdil,1,It's not there
,Arthur Giesbrecht,5,Fast and easy service!
,Seekingtruth Notfindingany,1,It is not there
,Kris Chorneychuk,1,"The ""maps"" icons all say ""open 24 hrs"" but they are inside office buildings. There is no signage outside of these buildings and they aren't visible thru the glass of the locked doors. I walked all over downtown past where 4 or 5 of these ""drop off"" locations are supposed to be - Saturday afternoon - and I couldn't drop off my parcels.
(Edit: doors on these buildings are all generally locked outside of M-F 8am-6pm)"
,Jesse Aarinola,4,Doesn't service Amazon returns. No direct number unfortunately have to wait on the main line for all of Purolator.
,Johan Jaimes,4,The entrance is over 330 Portage Av. The main entrance is locked and access is with a card only but people working at the building are very kind to open the door from the inside for you. The drop box is not easy to find but the security person was very kind to help me. The envelope was picked up the same day I dropped it off.
,Kamrul Chowdhury,5,Easy and secure location to drop of the return items. It is located near the back door of the building.
,Allan Miller,1,Package was left a day ahead of the appointment with no home to receive the package.  Package was just left on front steps. I attempted to contact them to resolve the issues and only got automated responses.  In short I was not happy with the service I got at all
,Sehajpreet Singh,5,"Guys this purolator is in Micheal (this store‚Äôs entrance is outside the mall ) and there is no sign or board saying ‚ÄúPUROLATOR‚Äù So just go inside ‚Äúmicheal‚Äùand ask about your parcel on  cash counter and they will give you your parcel üì¶ üí°, have a great day(coz the mark itself shows the location inside mall and i had to spend 10-20 minutes looking for Micheal inside mall ,while only store is inside mall but its entrance is outside it .. i had added some photos too google didn‚Äôt show it up (don‚Äôt know why) but atleast others don‚Äôt have to waste there time like i did)"
,Angel Peterson,1,Very hard to find.
,Richard B,5,
,Apofils Lawilka,5,"Good service - got my package, and sent back a return as well."
,Jonathan Munro,1,"Here's some advice. Use any shipping company other than Purolator. They aren't worth it. Unless you are home during business hours, they will never leave your package without a signature. If you ask them to deliver without requiring a signature, they will outright refuse. They wont leave your package at a local post office like every other delivery company. You will need to go to their depot to pick the package up. It's in the middle of nowhere and takes ages to get to, especially if you don't own a car and have to take the bus. Then they will only hold your package for 5 days. So I hope you can find time in that short duration to obtain your personal property. They are not a delivery company. Their job is to receive your property, tell you to pick it up from them and then dispose of it when you can't, which you pay a very high fee for. Use any other company, I'm telling you."
,OrangeHarrisson,1,"Pickup center that is basically in the Sticks, and you will need to go there every time you've been cursed to deal with them due to a clueless seller that won't use a proper shipping company since the delivery guy will not knock or call and will just leave a notice since they're in such a hurry.

Canada Post will call you and wait downstairs and the pickup points are always nearby, same with FedEx and UPS. Most inconvenient shipping company to deal with and always takes the whole day and 5 pieces of I.D and proof of address for them to finally release your parcel to you. Opening hours are a suggestion as well."
,Viviane Desbiens,1,"The service is fast, unfortunately if there is any issues/damaged with your package cause by them, you won't have any reemboursement or service for your lost. They won't even reembourse the shipping fee, so disappointing!"
,Joana Medeiros,1,"Their in-person service is even worse then their online services. I was rudely served only to be told my package is being held hostage. Please close and give the place to a better company. Incredible how I only have any major issues with Purolator compared to other companies like DHL, Canada Post, Intelcom, UPS, etc‚Ä¶

Absolutely not one email notification either, it‚Äôs like it thinks it‚Äôs operating in the year of 2000"
,Omar Sedky,1,"You are a scar on the face of the shipping industry, you should gather all your employees and have them line up, bending their knees and apologizing for each shipment that has been managed by this useless company! Save the universe and humanity and close this company!"
