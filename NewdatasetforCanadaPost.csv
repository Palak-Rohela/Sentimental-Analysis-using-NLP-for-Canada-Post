,RA M,1,"I always advise businesses to not allow customers waiting for service the time to write posts like this. And this is no exception. At the risk of sounding patronizing, let me give you some business, mathematics, language and ethics 101 lessons. Business hours are business hours. They communicate that customers can get service during these times. Not we might be open and “come back in 20 minutes when the person is done coffee break”.  Absolutely nothing against workers taking their much deserved breaks. But organizing around the staffing and their breaks is the responsibility of the business, and not the customer during business hours. But silly me, perhaps, for deigning to put a government agency like Canada Post in the category of a business. Or for that matter, the government of Canada and its so-called managers in the category of “by the people for the people…..”"
,Cookie,3,"Amazing mailing prices. Was really disappointed with my experience here today though. I have very poor handwriting due to my autism, and I asked the post office cashier if the addresses I wrote were readable. She didn’t answer my question, and instead responded with “Well, that’s the school’s fault for not teaching you to write.” in a condescending tone. I left feeling very uncomfortable."
,Mercedes Madison,2,"Not a bad location, but seem to be consistently out of stock of particular items for weeks. This is very frustrating to me as I rely on shipping supplies from this location to run a small business. Frequently they are out of certain items and do not restock for over two weeks. I have never had this issue with other locations"
,Narelle Waite,2,"I posted an intentional parcel and it was quite expensive and weighing just over 500grams, the assistant said he would check if making it under 500g would help. He lied, said he did and it didn't change anything. I have since checked with the Canada post website using the measurements of the postage parcel I purchased and both weight options. Postage halves from $42 to $22, I'm really angry about that - I'd have gladly removed an unnecessary 50gram item.
The man was pleasant but ultimately, unhelpful."
,Brad Taylor,5,Grateful for the hours and great staff at this Canada Post in Shoppers. Thank you for being open 7 days a week.
,E B,1,"This location has the most unknowledgeable staff of all Canada Post locations. Every trip is a significant wait. There’s a young man with an accent that has absolutely no ability to do any transaction that takes less than 20 minutes. When I first encountered him I thought maybe he was new and learning but 6 months later it’s kind of clear he’s just slow. He works at Canada Post and is not even familiar with how Canadian addresses are written! He types at the rate of about 3 words per minute and forgets information as soon as it is given to him - I watched him unable to take a phone number and kept repeating 613 even though the number started with 343 and the client repeated it over and over. Every trip here takes at least 20 minutes, even when there’s no line! And if there is a line - expect a wait of 30 - 40 minutes MINIMUM."
,Waldo Landorf,3,The older gentleman is very polite and helpful. The younger workers not so much. Be prepared for massive sticker shock sending a package . overseas especially a return. Exorbitant and the sign of a monopoly.
,Autumn Bigras,1,"My first negative review..if I could give zero stars I would

The staff member I dealt with absolutely had no clue how to work there and it was a really negative experience

Made three attempts to pick up package, would rather never go to that location again"
,Terri Hearn,5,I send quite a number of packages around Christmas and received many items over the year. The service is impeccable. The staff are very knowledgeable and kind. I love my post office. I will absolutely continue to use their services. I highly recommend.
,Andrea Burbidge,1,"I tried to pick up a package 3 times. The first time delivery was attempted, I was self-isolating at home. Somebody else (a Canada Post employee) signed my name for the package and marked it as delivered on August 2nd. At this point, the first investigation was opened by Canada Post.

Following this investigation, delivery was reattempted. I got a delivery notice on August 30th saying my package would be ready to pick up August 31st after 1pm. After 1pm, I arrive at the post office with my delivery notice. The man working there told me the package had already been delivered on August 2nd. I pointed out to him that the status update showed that it was out for delivery and being held as of August 30th, so it was clearly not delivered on August 2nd. As well, I had a delivery notice marked the 30th. He refused to acknowledge that it couldn't have been delivered on the 2nd, kept pointing at the progress bar, and refused to physically check the back for the package. He advised me to call Canada Post.

I called Canada Post and opened a second investigation. Following that investigation, I received a third delivery notice on September 1st, stating my package would be ready for pickup on September 2nd after 1pm.

On September 2nd, I arrived at the post office after 1pm and asked if I could pick up my package. I was told it had already been delivered - on August 2nd. Once again, the same employee refused to go physically check in the back. I had to phone back Canada Post, and have them on speaker phone with this man at the post office. The nice woman on the phone from Canada Post assured this man that she had seen the package in his post office yesterday, and asked him to go check physically. Only at this point did the man go check the back for the package. Lo and behold, it was there.

At this point, this man starts explaining to me everything that I had done wrong. He point to the delivery notice and said it could only be picked up by the addressee. As I was the addressee, this was a bizarre point to make. Overall it was one of the worst customer service experiences I have ever had, and I will do anything in my power to avoid going back here."
,Anita E,5,"Great customer service, never had an issue here. Barbara is super helpful and I'm always confident my packages will be dispatched efficiently here. Thank you!"
,Dakkar (Rabanne),1,The woman that works there in the afternoons is rude and has an attitude if you ask for a receipt. I wish they’d replace her
,Megan Farquhar,1,"Horrible horrible horrible service constantly! They have lost my packages on a number of occasions. Once they even gave me someone else’s package when going to pick up my own, I didn't notice until I was already back home and opening it! The employees are always miserable and rude, often leaving the desk unattended for 10+ minutes at a time. Most recently they said my package wasn't delivered just for me to go in a few days later looking for a different package that also “wasnt delivered” (although I got both confirmation emails) but when I went in for the second package the first magically appeared! Ridiculous. Will never use this post office again."
,Joan Beverley,5,Great service fast and the staff alway polite. Barbara thank you for your professionalism.
,Christi Volden,4,Conveniently located in College Square’s Rexall. I had no idea it was there until I searched for a post office in the area - a newer sign would draw more attention to it. The service was good. I did have to wait quite a while (like most post offices) even though there was only one person in front of me. Will be going back for future post office needs.
,Germaine Cornellier,5,Sometimes a big lineup. People seem to have very complicated postal needs. Staff is friendly and efficient. Very helpful.
,Sylvia Z,1,"RACIST post office!! There was an employee wearing black glasses, brunette hair in a pony tail, working around 12pm on Jan 30. She was extremely rude and unhelpful, I asked her what their biggest box looked like and she just stood there pointing and said to me Can't you see it? It’s right there. As it turns out, the largest box there had no label or price tag. She kept pointing towards the English words on the box, and asked me if I could not read English? I am not fluent in English even now my friend is helping me write this review. Instead of being helpful and kind she was being racist. I don't know why they still keep this kind of person working here. There was also no manager I could report her to. This attitude is not suitable for customer service, stay at home, don't come to this location."
,Dimas Rodriguez,1,"I went to pick up my package , 6:40pm on a Tuesday and no one in the counter and it was CLOSED? Go to the Canada post at shoppers? 322 Rideau st?…. You guys have to change working hours guys it says you close at 7:00pm"
,H Boomer,2,"Poor, illogical customer service: staff moved my parcel into the busy customer service area, then complained that I was taking too long and blocking the customer service area - after THEY moved it there. Did not provide tracking info, I had to go back into the customer service line and ask for it - shouldn’t that info be provided by default? Bizarre behavior. If they provided normal, reasonable customer service, it would make their lives and the customers’ lives easier."
,Emma,1,"Very slow service at this location.
Edit: I would give this place 0 star if I could. I needed to pick up a parcel this morning, I showed her my bar code and my ID, and asked for further examination because the name on the parcel didn't match my ID. Well, I have a preferred name and a legal name, and the one on my parcel is my preffered name, the last name match each other. Also, I showed her the bar code through my phone. If I were to steal the package that supposedly didn't belong to me, I'd have to steal the phone, know the password of the phone, get to the correct canada post office, and have an ID that's a close match to the information on the parcel... I got upset with the manager and she got angry and refused to give me the package at first. I asked her to do her job and check the address. Of course, the address matched the record. She insisted that I need to use the exact name on my ID next time in order to pick up my parcel next time. I'm stunned by the stubbornness and stupidity of her. I would avoid using this Canada Post in the future."
,John _GYS,5,"These ladies are sharp! I wish I got their names today. They were right on top of a tricky little “envelope in an envelope, and track it all” dance. They were super helpful, concise, and pleasant. They keep things moving really well, but please continue to go to your usual post office and not make a long queue at this one, if you don’t mind.. just kidding.. lol"
,Abby,2,Customer service is usually friendly but half the time there’s nobody at the desk. They close earlier than expected and today I went in at 11:30 (they opened at 11) and nobody was there. Shoppers staff said that the worker was running an hour late but this is a crown Corp and shouldn’t be happening.
,Leo Lin,5,"I drive extra 15 minutes to send all my mails here. Canadapost is a pain to deal with in general. However, this particular location always offer professional and timely services that exceed my expectations. Highly recommended!"
,Aisha,5,"A million thanks for the super fast, friendly and understanding Gemma.I had to come here from another branch and I'm glad I came."
,Chris,1,"Definitely the worst experience I’ve ever had in a store before. I went in to purchase a couple credit card gift cards at Canada Post, I paid cash, and then their POS computer froze without processing the transaction. They waited maybe 5 minutes for it to come back to life with no luck, they decided to force it off using the power button but it ended up freezing upon start-up. I asked for my money back and they refused stating their policy that gift cards aren’t refundable. But I hadn’t even been given a receipt or any confirmation that the gift cards had any value. So they decided to call a 1-800 internal help number but they were placed on hold. They made me wait for 10, 20, 30, 40 minutes! I asked to speak to a manager and the manager refused to provide a refund stating that once they got through on the phone and confirmed that the payment went through than I could have my gift cards…not my money back. I explained that I can’t take the gift cards without a receipt but they still insisted on not refunding me. I’m quite certain that legally I was entitled to receipt not their word that the cards had value.

It was close to their eight o’clock closing time so they tried again to shut down and restart the till, it took maybe 10 minutes for it fully to boot up. No computer should take that long. Any computer with a processor made in the past 10 years with a Solid State Drive should take no more than 2 minutes to load fully. I overheard the employees talking to each other saying that the computer crashes often…then why don’t you call tech support and have them replace it? In the end the computer did fully start-up and there was confirmation that my purchase did not go through and I got my money back. The worst part was that the manager didn’t apologize, try to make the situation any better, or appear to even care about my situation. Instead of the manager trying the fix the situation, he left it up to his two employees. While I was leaving he was over in the makeup department laughing it up with the women there. My biggest regret is not getting his name. You wasted almost an hour of my time."
,Habib Khan,1,"A racist old lady works there. I Went there to send something but decided not to send the parcel due to high shipping cost. I was extremely polite is telling the lady that I do not want to send it anymore, because the content was not worth even $5 where the quoted shipping cost was $15.
She made a very audible sound expressing her frustration while making an annoyed face and looked away from me. Would not say anything, would not acknowledge me anymore!
If anyone from Canada Post is reading this, please investigate this and take action. You have hired a racist individual , who has no place in your team. Everyone else, AVOID this location."
,Laura Egli,4,"They are open late here which is nice. There is pretty much always a line at this location, but the staff are just so helpful and friendly (not something you always find these days)."
,Gary Green,1,"Typical Canada Post work ethics, arrived at the post office located inside the Shoppers Drug mart located at 3781 Strandherd Dr, Ottawa just before it was supposed to open at 11:00a.m.  There were 5 people in line waiting for the post office to open, however, the person working that day Kyle Brown was not there.  I enquired at the pharmacy desk asking where the C.P. employee was.  I was told at 11:08 Kyle was on his way.  This type of service is absolutely ridiculous, I drove there to  mail one letter but was not going to wait for Kyle to show up.  Employees like Kyle Brown who do not honour their hours of work should be fired.  Everyone in line today was not too happy having to wait for this inconsiderate employee of Canada Post."
,Linh Nguyen,5,"I usually go here because of exceptional service. The tall dude with the deep voice cracked a few jokes once and he made me laugh. Good vibes.

Yesterday was a tough day, apperently a staff member recently quit and they were short staff, the line was long. I was sending some of my art work to my friend across the country and was gonna take the prepaid box since I didn't have any packaging and that was the easiest option ($27). He pointed out that there's another option if I don't want tracking, only $8, and even cut up cardboard to help prevent my art print from being damaged. Much much appreciated.

Hope he finds good staff soon and know that he's doing a great job holding the fort down."
,G V. E.,5,Gentleman who works at this post office is incredibly helpful. 10/10 service.
,Luc Dupuis,5,"Harman provided exceptional customer service to me and my family to ensure that our packages, that are super important to us, have been sent asap. I hope you deal with him again in the near future."
,Darshan Patel,5,Exceptional service provided by Harman. He is very supportive and helpful. He suggested me when I was confused. Highly recommended this place. Don't go by the ratings.
,Becky Reid,1,"This Canada Post location has no respect for customers. They should not provide posted business hours as they open and close when they want to. There have been numerous occasions, including today, where I have arrived well within their posted hours of operation to see them closed.

This should not be an acceptable standard business practice.

In addition to this, if they happen to be open, they provide extremely slow service. It is common to be in line for 15-30 minutes even if there is only one person ahead of you.

I highly recommend you go to a different location."
,Al,5,"I honestly dont know why this postal office has such a bad rating. I was served by Bev, she was bilingual and super nice. I go to alot of different postal offices and Bev is probably in my top 3 favorite staff. She is efficient and serves me with a smile."
,Faiz H,5,I don't know what all the fuss is about. I had 28 packages all individually addressed and it was a smooth process. Cody carried a great conversation with us and explained the procedure on how to get them all sent out. We let him deal with customers in between our large multi shipment. I promise you'll have an easy and efficient time with Cody behind the desk. Thanks for your help!
,Stacy DuBois,1,"I waited for about 10 minutes before an employee finally came to ""help"" me. She insisted that she was incapable of printing out a return label for my online purchase even though it's a routine thing I've done at many other Canada Post locations. I asked for her to call someone who could actually help me and she refused, insisting that she is the person in charge. I took my package to another post office and (surprise, surprise) they very quickly and easily printed out the return label and accepted the package. Definitely won't bother returning to this location since they apparently don't seem to know how their own systems work."
,Kayla Monaghan,1,Don't trust the posted hours. I arrived at 8pm on a day it was supposed to be open until 9pm and it was already closed.
,techie tran,5,"Give yourself ample time since the shop is quite busy from 5-6pm with long line of customers waiting to be served and you might end up leaving full-handed. Decent experience with the staff, big thank to Théresè who helped me with sending several heavy, large boxes."
,Pitch Sookmark,1,"I used to ship and pick up at a different branch for years until I am forced to come to this ""new branch"" a few years back by Canadapost. I really hate it at this branch due to long line, slow, lethargic service. An old lady at my old branch can process mail twice as fast as these trainees here.  Also, I once had a package to pick up and they couldn't find it for weeks. They made me go thru claims which was denied because Canadapost  insisted the package was at this branch. A month later, I decided to go back and try again and there it was--my package!! No one called to tell me it was sitting there for weeks, and no apologies of any kind. I pleaded w Canadapost for me to go back to my old branch to no avail. The best I could do is avoid using Canadapost altogether whenever I can."
,Josh Matthews,1,Canada post employees serving customers who were not masked during the COVID-19 pandemic. The same rules should apply to all customers. Customers should not have to tolerate or regulate inconsiderate patrons who want to spread disease to others. Canada post employees should be enforcing face mask rules.
,Allison Smith,1,The post office was closed at 1:10 today until 1:45 with just a sign and no way to leave a pre-paid package. Very frustrating. They should post lunch closures in the opening times
,Reema Sriv,5,Kind and courteous staff. Hardly any queue if you go in the afternoon.
,Jagtar Sian,1,"Worst customer service:

1. Lighter man at Canada Post desk refused to scan the returning package.
This happened twice already. Why Canada Post doesn't enforce proper training and policy to their retailers?

2. I sent two Express Post packages, Friday, and they didn't show any progress until Tuesday evening. Although, it was promised to be delivered in two days but system is still showing ""Scheduled delivery by end of next day""."
,SaRa NeGm,1,"This is the last time I will use their service. We sent very important documents to the Canadian Government on Xpress option, and they have lost the documents!!.
The tracking number only shows that it's in transit and no further update is available and customer service are the worst they are unhelpful and kept saying they are working on it.
I thought Canada post will be the best to deliver these documents but I was absolutely wrong.
Never use them for your important packages!"
,Jon D,1,Slowest service I've ever experienced. I think it took them 25 minutes to service 7 people...not like that at ups or FedEx thats for sure.
,Craig Bittle,1,"Never even attempted to deliver my package, they said they weren’t able to deliver at this location. My house where I get things delivered weekly! The website was updated to say they could deliver before they even attempted. Disappointed in Canada post."
,Melanie MacRae,2,"I sent a time sensitive letter by xpresspost on Friday May 13/22. Tracking has said out for Delivery today May 17/22 at 7:34 am, by 2:10 p.m. item re-routed due to processing error. The cost for this letter was $19.14. The clerk changed the postal code from what I was originally given by the addressee, saying there was a postal box. I called said addressee to advise the letter was sent xpresspost and gave tracking number and the postal code changed by the clerk. I was informed by the addressee that they no longer had the postal box. So now if this letter gets returned , it voids my time sensitivity. Not very happy that I had the right Postal Code and the clerk thinks I did not because the Canada Post info on it’s computer said so. Update your info. This is now costing me money. So update as of May 30th/22 Because of the postal code being wrong as per Canada Posts Postal Code, delivery has not occurred and now the letter cannot be found, as Per a Canada Post Supervisor in Ottawa as of 1:30 p.m. today. Other arrangements had to be made for business I was dealing with. This is unacceptable for a Crown Corporation and outlets!"
,Danielle,5,I have always had such great experiences with the staff at this Canada Post. Even when I'm not in the best mood waiting for packages the staff continuously goes above and beyond for me and I appreciate it so much! The day staff is great but I usually deal with Johnathan at night he's usually by himself with a large line dealing with everyone as quickly as possible with a smile. Really exceptional service!
,VK,1,"Yesterday evening the employee was chatting with one client over 15 minutes, while the line keep growing. Be ready to spend there 30 minutes or an hour to send something."
,Sami LastName,5,They were super kind about the amount of packages alongside helping me get them ready to ship out. Fran is absolutely awesome!
,Aisha,1,"Don't waste your time coming to this branch. I had a problem in this branch for the first time today for my mails that I have been sending to my customers for 2 years and have never had any problems.The old woman tried her best not to send my parcel. and that's what she said. If there was 0 points, I would believe it because it doesn't deserve 1 point. I was able to send the same cargo within 3 minutes when I went to Canada post on eaglosan street just ahead."
,Zee Vodkaphile,1,"If I could give zero stars I would. This post office is terrible. I hate that it's the one all my parcels go to by default. Let's start with the fact that they're often closed, with a single sign posted on their counter that says ""closed today, sorry"" without changing the hours posted online. 5 times in the last 6 weeks I've went to pick up a package, and this place is closed for one reason or the other, without anything being posted online. I've literally never experienced this in 30 years of using mail. I went back 3 times in December to pick up a package that was a Christmas gift... they were closed due to ""technical difficulties"" all 3 times. But still sent my package back to the sender within their allotted 15 days to pick up. Had to pay duties and reshipping. No grace period for pickup due to you being closed multiple days?

I feel so bad for the management at Rexall, because their store page is review bombed with ratings that explicitly mention the post office, and have nothing to do with the actual Rexall."
,Vadym Serdiuk,1,"Worst customer service I ever had.
Instead of helping me to send the package she organized a second line and I waited for every other client she serviced. In total it took approximately one hour to send a parcel. That old lady is something. She also blamed me in front of other people from the line…"
,DL Calendar,1,"Take the extra drive down to Shoppers on Eagleson or any post office in canada to be honest. Worst customer service ever at a Canada post office (stand alone or in a pharmacy). Ever seen Seinfeld try to order soup? Now imagine it at a post office. They take a simple task/job and make the customer jump through hoops and do their job for them. Literally refuse any assistance. Former staff were wonderful (more than 5yrs ago). They are the reason I ship with FedEx now. Todays visit (for a return to Amazon) will def be my last. Besides, judging by the occupancy at the mall, they won’t be there long.

Seriously, pick another post office or Canada Post; do better at this location. For everyone’s benefit"
,Lola Artesanal,2,"Unbelievably slow customer service with the older lady. Shipping a package, she spends at least 10 minutes PER PERSON, completely oblivious to the fact that there are at least 5 people in line. If you can avoid going in the afternoon!"
,Henry,1,"Not sure if the lady I encountered is the same lady other reviewers have been mentioning but the service here is really poor and argumentative. I came here a few times, once for an ID verification and twice for parcel drop offs and the short angry lady is always so rude. Had to show her proof/documentation from the website for her to process one of my service requests, she's constantly on her phone/distracted and just overall, not pleasant. Would highly recommend you insist you get a tracking receipt for anything you drop off, it only takes a few seconds but protects you to show Canada Post received the item, should it get lost somehow."
,Carl Asuncion,1,"The female employee I dealt with this afternoon at this Canada Post location was horrible. She was confrontational and dismissive from the second I got to the counter. She was sitting by the register but had no intention of providing me a service. I waited patiently and gave her my return parcel when she finally acknowledged I was there. Then, she refused to give me a receipt citing that it was only 4:45 PM and she was going to scan all returns at the end of her shift. She told me her best advice was to take a picture of the return label if I wanted to track it. Then she told me that if I had a problem with that, I could go to another Canada Post location. I feel that I explained respectfully and calmly that asking for a receipt for my return is common and has never been an issue in the past. She was not pleased with me challenging her approach. When I left, she cursed me ""under her breath"" but in a clearly audible way. I hope this review helps someone avoid such an unpleasant experience. I, for one, will try my best never to return. I'm guessing that's exactly what she prefers as well given how she treated me."
,Alex Boyce,1,"Not being a picky individual i would generally lean away from writing any negative online reviews, but many individual reviews about the staff are in fact correct. Female individuals are moody, and confrontational towards customers. In times where a large amount of service is leaning towards delivery, and postage where assisting individuals is important towards our daily lives it's unfortunate to see staff that is not willing to assist customers because you've arrived 7 minutes before closing, and excuses are made in order to avoid assisting customers. Many people now days are ordering things online due to little alternative, and the assistance of a national postage company is key on many levels. There are many people who would be very happy to have a job like this and show effort and gratitude for such an opportunity."
,P. L.,1,"Terrible service with the new worker. I have been using this location for a very long time. Asked me many times about postal code in HK when I sent my package and I told her that they don't use postal code and she said to me that ""it's better to have a postal code"".  3 days later, I received my own package back at my door with no explanation. Canada post give people a choice to pay for tracking or not, but without tracking , they don't help you at all even you have a receipt to prove. Wasting my Money and time. Do not go to this location"
,Emma -,5,"I have been reading reviews and I am surprised to see some people were treated really poorly by the staff. I do not doubt it was true, but in my experience, I had no issue what so ever. Neither with ""a"" lady at the Post Canada section (I don't know her name, but she was nice to me and I do not know if she is the same person the negative reviews are referring to) or with the clerk at the register. I don't go there often to have noticed their names or asked them, or to even know if it is always the same people.
I just want to share ""my"" experience. I had no issue and people were very nice and polite with me.
I hope who ever wronged the other people will change their attitude.
After all, we write reviews hoping it will make a difference and help others, as well as the businesses to improve their service, or to receive some encouragement if they are doing the right thing.
Ideally, the business will address the negative comments and try to solve the issues."
,Sherry Xie,2,"Went to send a package at the Canada Post at 4:40pm on Monday and there was nobody there, was told the employee was late and there was nothing they could do to help me. Wish the Rexall employee was trained to help customers with simple returns."
,Phil Yassa,5,"I prefer this location over the one at Shoppers Drug Mart in South Keys. The staff here seems to be positive and courteous, and I’ve never really had to wait in line. No complaints"
,Merlin,1,Rude girl working behind the counter last night…. Seriously needs to get another job if she can’t or won’t at least be semi courteous. Joke really!!
,Al,4,"Situated inside the Rexall. Usually only one staff at checkout only, which sometimes gathers long line ups."
,Adrian Marko,5,"I have been using this facility for a number of years. I have never had any problem, purchasing stamps, mailing & receiving parcels & /or registered letters, arranging "" hold-mail'. Everyone there are friendly, efficient, & knowledgeable. If employee is elsewhere in the store, a tap on the bell & they are right there."
,V,3,"The Post Office employees are great but the employees at the Shoppers are terrible. I was new in the neighborhood was told the post office was closed, the manager of the shoppers was angry, when I asked so he yelled and snaped at me. He gave me the wrong directions to find a different post office (on purpose) which brought me to an unsafe area, and it was late night. The next day when he saw me he was smirking, and grinning... very questionable individual."
,Deanna Robertson,1,"Every single time I come here there is only one person working at the Canada Post counter and a line at least 5 people long. The wait is always 15+ minutes and they never call for help/have another person available to open another cash. Ridiculous. If it’s 5pm, you need two people. Simple as that."
,Jacqueline Menard,1,Very poor service I went to 541 Montreal road may 23 2023 to return packages and they did not scan my item. I have been given the run around call canada post. I cannot have a ticket to investigate as it was scanned but apparently not by canada post. That is ridiculous because they received my 3 other items and not this item. I even went to talk to the guy Youssef who did not scan my one item and he said I can’t do anything call Canada post. This means I lose 150$ for a refund that I returned but Youssef forgot to scan. This is unacceptable!!!
,Cody Alberry,1,I come here to drop packages off all the time and it never takes less than 30 minutes. they only ever have one staff member at the cash and inevitably some boomer needs 30 minutes of help and this hold up the while line.
,First Time Grow,1,"If your looking to deal with someone who hates there job and tells you the reason you waited 5 min then had to ask a shoppers drug mart employee to have them paged to serve you , only to he told the employee was having there morning tea and you should have waited.
Then this is the place rude staff , i sudgest you have a few come back insults ready or be prepared to be insulted and be welcomed as a inconvenience.  That being said you would think people would be happy to still have a job these days but not thos location."
,Kelly,1,"Every single time I come in, they aren't at the desk and have signs that they are away for 5-20 minutes. It is never consistent timing. If they are on breaks, they should be the same time every day. It is the second time I come to mail this package and they are gone. A sign says back in 5 minutes but I have been standing here for longer than 5 minutes now."
,Al,4,"Sometimes has a long line up, should have more than 1 staff onsite during peak hours. Other than that the staff are always available for question and very kind."
,Jessica Hebb,1,Website shows that the post office opens at 9am and there’s a sign just taped up saying 12. The website should be updated if the hours change.
,Jessica Erhardt,5,Always kind staff. I saw comments regarding hours… I find they always have a just reason for it. When there is one staff they still deserve a lunch break so unfortunately it has to close for that break to happen. It’s the same at my work. This is my favourite location.
,Tamara Mask,1,"Is supposed to be open until 5 today, it's not even 4pm and there is no one there or no note saying that it's temporarily closed."
,Dashan Wang,1,"No customer service. The old male clerk left for over 20mins for personal reason and people has to just wait.

The clerk himself is way too slow"
,Zafaar Shawnawrooz,1,"Their schedule shows open at 9:00AM
It is past 9:10 am and no one here yet
The line up is getting longer lol
Finally someone should up and said “the post office is not opening till 11 today"
,Al,4,"Customer service is so-so. The clerk looked really bored and didn’t talk loud enough for me to hear properly. Still, very convenient location and rarely has huge line-ups."
,Marlie Hensen,1,"The older Indian gentleman that worked there on August 30th was horrendous. Witnessed him yelling at his coworker…calling him names, degrading him. It was over a mistake the other man made when speaking on the phone to a customer (the older man literally grabbed the phone out of his hand). I stood there for several minutes watching this unfold and he had no worry about berating his coworker in front of me…nor with getting my packages taken care of in any timely manner. I reported the incident to several Shoppers staff members, but I assume they have no pull when it comes to the Canada Post staff. Regardless-this man needs anger management and to be relieved of his job."
,Jiani Li,5,"Very nice and helpful people! The person that helped me, Soheil, was very patient when I was confused with the receiver's address, which was in the format of Switzerland. Helped me out a lot with packaging when he noticed that I want to ship something that has glass on it. If I was the manager of this post office I will be smiling when I sleep to have him work here."
,"Nghia Huynh, Ca",5,"I experienced bad time and good time with the staff.  But after all , the friendly atmosphere happens with a little patience and understanding and good communication. Be patient when you wait in line."
,Back 2back,5,"Great customer service, thanks to girl that was working there"
,hsurms k,1,"One of MOST PATHETIC HOPELESS AND USELSS CANADA POST LOCATION and its my experience today 6th Jan 2023 at this location for the older lady who was there around 7.30PM. if she DOES NOT KNOW HER JOB AND SAYS SHE IS DOING A FAVOR BY STAYING THERE. SHE SHOULD GET HERSELF FIRED. After coming 3rd after the first time when location was not in service, second when a young lady dint know how to perform the service and told politely. THIS PATHETIC RUDE HOPELESS LADY TODAAY WHO IS NOT INTERESTED IN HER JOB INSTEAD OF POLITELY SAYING SHE IS INCOMPETENT, SAYS SHE DOES A FAVOR OF COMING HERE AND CANNOT DO THE JOB, SHE IS A BLOT TO CANADA POST AND BLOT TO HUMANITY….DARCY, WAYNE FIRE SUCH PEOPLE WHO ARE A DISSERVICE AND CANYT EVEN APOLOGISE FOR THEIR INCOMPETENCE. HOPELESS!!!"
,Anastassiya Puchshina,5,Darcy and his team are amazing! Service is always professional and as quick as possible. The working hours are also perfect for the downtown location.
,Ali Saleem,5,The guy working there was very helpful. Keep it up!
,Audrey B,5,Hashim and Kari did an amazing job answering all my questions and providing me pricing options to send my mail. Hashim also provided up to date information on postal outlets closures and openings in the neighbourbood. A+ team.
,Rosa,1,"Paul has been rude and condescending on multiple occasions.
Recently he told me I had to purchase tape to close my package he wouldn’t let me use the tape on the table.."
,Phil M,5,"Great location, service has always been quick and helpful.

Not sure what the previous 1* review is referring to: the software Canada Post uses on their point of sale systems is the same regardless of franchise or not. Plus the employees are not the franchise owner, so they don't stand to benefit from scamming customers, as the reviewer is accusing them of."
,Bob S,1,"This Canada post will scam you. The older gentleman tried to charge me over $16 for a package I’ve been shipping from other locations for $3.12
They are most likely an independent service center (contractors) so they make money through dishonesty. A real Canada post would not do that because the employees have nothing to gain from overcharging."
,Raghad Rowaida,5,Sent a small parcel to Bangladesh in COVID time. took 11 days to reach. Customer service was very helpful.
,Sandra Yilmaz,5,"In all my years of using this PO, I cannot remember any bad experiences with staff. Whoever I dealt with is always helpful if I have questions, and I am always courteous to them as well.   Sometimes, especially around Christmas, the wait lines can be long.  Best to plan ahead, as staff will be overworked. A smile and a compliment are always helpful at these times."
,A W,1,If I could give zero stars I would. Not just for the Marivale shoppers drug mart Canada post location but for all Canada post locations. I usually go to ups but accidentally printed a Canada post label so I had no choice but to come here. They all require you to purchase tape to stick your label on the box. They will not help you at all. Unlike ups you just drop your box and label they do everything for you.
,Gary Howard,1,"Very poor ! I paid 17$ for an overnight to Peterborough for Sept1
I tracked it and it says arrives Sept 5 . Spoiled the occasion
Shipped Aug 31 to arrive Sept1 Occasion on Sept 2. I was doubly assured by the two clerks it would be no problem ! well done CP"
,Zeina Naserdine,1,"TERRIBLE Customer service, I came in to return a few packages (drop off without a receipt at 4:55PM) the staff wouldn’t take me at all “Jasmeet” the lady serving kept yelling saying she’s going to miss her bus, I told her it was important because today was my last day to return them. She responded with “I DONT CARE GET OUT” another gentleman came in and told everyone else to leave as well. This is extremely unacceptable given her shift wasn’t over,  I will not be coming back to this location. I demand this be addressed and I will be opening up a bigger complaint with the BBB."
,Mandi,1,"Have had to come to this location many times. Staff are always unfriendly. I hate having to pick up my package and deal with this location. I’ve never had one positive experience in all the times I’ve had to go there. All your staff have the same bad attitude. Who runs your hiring process?... They also have different “policies” for each individual. Makes you wonder if they are actually trained or coming up with whatever policy suits them at the time.
Just awful all around."
,Lorne Goldenberg,1,Waited 15 min with no lineup while someone was getting trained on an international shipping.  Asked if I could be helped at another cash as there was no indication of them ever finishing.  The answer was no and they were training for another 3 hours.  Could have walked my packages to Montreal faster 🤷🏻‍♂️
,Guillaume Billette,5,Very fast service and the clerk was nicew.
,Elizabeth H,5,"Every time I go here (and I go here at least once a week, I think I've met everybody who works here), the people behind the counter are friendly and patient and helpful. They're happy to explain different shipping options, answer questions, check you've added enough postage, and lend you a bit of tape/a pen if you forgot yours. Nice place, even if there is sometimes a line."
,catherine desjardins,5,"I have been a customer of this post office for 27 years.  They are a great group of employees of PharmaSave who are very well versed on the multitude of offerings of Canada Post.  This is a Retail Post Office, it is not owned and operated by Canada Post. Cda Post over see it and sell their product there but the employees are paid/work  by/for  the Pharmacy.  If one has complaints of about home mail delivery speak to Cda Post it has nothing to do with this  retail outlet. The employees are friendly and  keep the  line moving thru as best as they are able and as best as the customer is prepared for posting their delivery.  IF they let a package go thru the letter system and it was too big to meet letter size delivery, that item would be destroyed in the automated Cda Post sorting system.  Listen to their recommendations they know what they are saying.  They do not get any bonus to charge more...they are just trying to get your package to where ever you want it to go.  Great group, highly recommend this local post office."
,Pippa Beck,1,"I have only been here once but also found their ""service"" to be extremely poor, bordering on contemptuous. They seemed to take glee in pointing out how customers had improperly packaged things, addressed things, etc. I had a small package that I had placed inside an envelope and which I was hoping could be sent as an envelope and not a parcel. The woman ""serving"" me made a bit of a show proving that it was too thick to be dropped through the plastic slot measurement tool. No stars, although I had to register one to post this review."
,mysterious,1,"Better dont go there .. worst worst attitude. I went over there for Uber verification.  I gave her my license and health card as proof of id's . She said it's not acceptable.  I never had a problem before like this. She said i need a passport and license and also some mail or bill.she was like, ""i dont make rules."" i talked with triton(verification agency), and they said health card and license are sufficient.  I dont know how they get a job ."
,R,1,"Avoid this Canada Post location if you can.
Almost always busy, even at odd off peak hours it's slow and busy.  There's always like 5+ people doing money transfers, which take 15+ minutes each,. And then always people who are preparing packages there. The employees are slow with assisting each person as well. I come in with my pre prepared and labeled packages ready to just drop off and I have to wait 20+ minutes every time. There's 1 employee who will let me leave my package on the counter but the other main employee refuses to allow me to leave it. What's the point of pre preparing a package only to waste time waiting in line? Why can't Canada Post have a secure drop bin inside each outlet?

I'd suggest heading down the street to the thistledown location or to the one on Finch east of Islington. Much less hassle and waiting around.

Loved in the area for years, not sure why it's taken me this long to pair this."
,preetha n,5,I was served by Ankita. She was so helpful and friendly. Really appreciate her service!
,Yanci Flores,1,"I get that working at the CanPost isn't exactly easy and that more times then not you get a lot of bad customers, but I do believe in behaving in an acceptable manner towards those few customers that give you a genuine smile and are polite to the staff. This isn't the first time I go to this location and have one of the guys at the front desk give me attitude for no reason, I tend to avoid this location but unfortunately I can't always do that. Please be nice to your customers we aren't all A*holes"
,Tom Thompson,1,Do not go here. This place is stealing peoples stuff the two Asian looking guys that work there are thieves. Or just really incompetent I’ve sent stuff many times the second I go here my stuff gets lost or they stole it and I lose over $100 worth of stuff not counting the money I paid for it to be sent    it’s not Canada Post it’s this place only go anywhere but here
,Mohammad Abu-Marzouk,5,"I recently visited a Canada Post office in Mississauga Ontario inside Shoppers Drug Mart 5035 Hurontario Street and was blown away by the exceptional service and support provided to local small businesses.

The staff was not only professional but also extremely friendly and welcoming, as soon as I walked in, I was greeted with warm smiles and a genuine desire to help you find the best shipping solutions for your needs.

If you're looking for a Canada Post office that truly goes above and beyond to support local small businesses, look no further than the office run by FILIZ and her team Kiran and Manjusha.

I had the pleasure of being assisted by all FILIZ, who went above and beyond to ensure that I received the best possible service. She took the time to understand my business needs and offered a variety of solutions that would help save our company money. Her dedication and willingness to help left a lasting impression on me.

Not only is the staff incredibly knowledgeable and helpful, but they also go out of their way to promote small business programs that can save you money on shipping costs.

FILIZ, in particular, is an absolute gem - she's always eager to help and finds creative ways to save our company money while still ensuring our documents arrive on time.

Overall, I highly recommend this Canada Post office Location to anyone looking for exceptional service and support for their small business. The staff is knowledgeable, friendly, and always willing to go above and beyond to ensure that every client is satisfied and happy.
If you're a small business owner looking for a shipping partner that cares about your success, this is the office for you!"
,Cynthia Yi,1,Extremely horrible customer service at the checkout desk. The person rejected provide service. Instead he shouting at me and accusing me why I did not use self checkout. Management should clarify the job duties to this person and educate him that’s how he gets pay.
,Kevin Arrata,1,Complete incompetence. Make up their own rules on what IDs they want to accept. Uneducated in their roles and unaware of how to speak with customers. An abysmal experience all around that I’ll be contacting head office about.
,Majdi Shahein,1,"Horrible experience today with the supervisor (she said she’s “the one”).

We immediately made a complaint at the head office and were told the complaint is being taken very seriously and was escalated to ""the right people"".

Let’s see, we’ll not be going to this Canada Post as long she still works there."
,N. Gomes,1,"I went to the Canada Post outlet at the shoppers drug Mart store inside the square one mall.  The guy, Hawza, was terrible in the sense that he had a long line of customers but continued having a personal conversation on his cellphone.  How is it possible that this person could ignore customers while venting with the other person at the end of the line about ""a colleague who was fired and has now ruined the situation for the other employees""."
,Manuj Jain,1,"I was told if I write  senders name at the bottom of my letter , my letter will be returned  to me , quite surprisingly.

When I asked WHY , NO LOGIC  , NO APPROPRIATE  REASON was given .

I asked if it’s rule then show me where it’s written in the book
Neither it’s on Canada Post website
They were not able to justify their own statement .
I have been sending letters from decades and no one ever objected  not to write senders name at the bottom and never heard that my mail will be returned .

Are they making their own rules and imposing on people without  any reasoning ?"
,Nazim Ali,1,"I wish I can give 0 star! Long lines and one person working there, also very slow!"
,Max Mahone,5,Rishma helped me out she’s very helpful and professional unlike many other staff members that have no idea what they’re doing.
,Gurleen Nagpal,1,Bad service. Even during busy hours there’s only 1 employee. They are always understaffed and will spend more than 30 mins on each customer.
,Mctpy L,2,"Very slow service, they usually have 2 employees where it would be a lot faster if they have a pick up line only as that line customer already know what they want vs the confused customers.."
,Marium Owais,1,"Lady behind Canada post counter was very rude. When i went a couple of days ago to pick up my parcel there was a sign saying they are temporarily closed and the estimated time of opening is 12 noon and I was reading that when she came up to me and rudely and loudly said we are closed, we are closed. And I replied. Yes I read the sign. So mean. She truly needs some classes in manners and customer service."
,nicholas sangineto,1,The lady was not patient at all. When i was talking face to face to her suddenly she left and start do something else without to say anything to me . But she was listening me. How polite peoples are in Toronto…
,M Lau,1,Older lady behind the counter was incompetent and rude. Asked you a question and immediately just spoke over you blaming the customer on why she couldnt do her job correctly. She should be let go. I will not be back.
,ryan douros,1,"The woman with the glasses is very rude! An elderly man asked her a question while we were talking to her and she yelled at him and told him to wait his turn. Very disrespectful, very unprofessional."
,Shivam Verma,5,"The young lady working here is too good. Very supportive and friendly. I have seen many customers being rude to her without any reason  like today there was an issue with the system for some postal code and she suggested him to have a google search but the person insisted on going back and then after blamed her for his runarounds. I feel sorry for her and came just to have a say on other user’s allegation of terminating her. She is good and for the sake of new system, please treat the employees in humanely manner. And just how I see people post negative comments more than positive ones, please show the other side too."
,John H,5,"Lena is an absolute sweetheart. She always goes above and beyond to help her customers. When I come to Canada Post, I refuse to be served by anyone else but her. She truly is a remarkable person. Don't believe what other people are saying."
,Zain A.,1,"The lady named Lena who works at Canada post and looks after money gram is very RUDE! She just couldn’t speak nicely, she literally need some training on how to talk to a person nicely and how to provide customer service! I was very calm and it was my first visit to any Canada post and she just didn’t help me understand things. Just kept answering rudely! I wanted to leave that place and go to another Canada post but it was raining and I didn’t have car.
I barely write any reviews but her customer service forced me to write one. I was served by a lady named Lena and I have experienced the worst customer service yet!
She was rude from the very start when I called there to ask they do Moneygram."
,Ayah Tarot,1,"I would haven given zero to this post office! Absolutely the rudest person working here who messed up my Christmas card envelope with her marker without asking, then rudely did customer Survey on her own self to make it positive feedback!

First and foremost you will not fill customer satisfactory feedback on your own self without asking me putting a positive experience like I couldn’t caught what she was doing! I would’ve put negative experience but she pushed the button first. I am still in disbelief!"
,Stacy Wang,1,"I don’t know the name of that guy, woman with glasses and long black hair, and the only man in that place. They literally don’t know what’s they should do. And they also be racist. Very bad experience, never want to go back."
,May Zhu,1,"Very disappointing customer service, the lady named Lena needs to learn how to talk to people, I was polite and calm, but she basically yelled at me, I have no idea why she got so mad, or that's the way she talks?"
,Maria Annunziata,5,"Great customer care! Very polite, helpful and thorough. Truly cares about customer needs especially around prices. I am closer to another postal outlet but the lady who works at this Canada Post outlet is way better than others closer to where I live. I hope Canada Post rewards her as Employee of the Year with a raise and a promotion. In a day when people are superficial it is nice to find folks who enjoy what they do. Kudos to her!
The only issue with this SHOPPERS is the parking space. I wish management would allow for parking at the back. When it gets busy it becomes harder to find a parking."
,ToTo Ent,1,Please train your employee better. Seriously letting people don’t know the rule to work here. Came in with a commercial shipping label. The shipping label said 0.75kg but I’m allowed to ship up to 2.5kg. The staff refused to scan my item. Pick your employee probably
,Leonard,4,"This post office has friendly employees and great service, clean and well maintained. My Amazon purchases are delivered here for my convenience. The only con is the Shoppers Drug Mart parking lot, small and tight, not an easy exit at times. Open hours are prominently posted and it's open 7 days a week unlike my previous location at Keele and Lawrence. It's a longer drive for me but well worth the effort. Big thumbs up. Everyone has different opinions and experiences but my visits here were always positive."
,Junior Kam,1,They act so pro and rush you in then send the package to the wrong address
,M,5,The female staff at Canada Post was so friendly and sweet person especially on weekday. She was also very knowledge in Postal skills in Canada Post services. Very excellent and fast customer services!
,Aarman Pervaiz,1,WROST SERVICE FROM FADEEL. I BROUGHT AMAZON BOX FOR RETURN AND HE REJECTED. !!!!DONT GO TO THIS LOCATION!!! SUCH RUDE PERSON!! ZERO CUSTOMER SERIVE SKILLS.I TOLD HIM THAT I PAID $20 FOR RETURN LABEL AND HE WONT DO IT. SUCH A RUDE PERSON HE IGNORED ME AND TOOK THE NEXT PERSON. HE GOES I HAVE TO HELP OTHER CUSTOMER.. SO WHAT AM I??....
,Sumesh T,1,"Absolutely ridiculous customer care and looting more money from people for sending normal mail. I sent same mail to the same destination, first time they charged $25 and today they charged me $47."
,h,1,Very unhappy went to drop off a mail but the lady made it a courier unnecessarily just to make more money !!!!! when it could’ve been sent as a mail. They find ways to loot customers !!!!!
,Vishal Narayan,1,This is not how anything works. You can't just randomly shut off the post office because you feel so even though it it within your official business hours. This is an essential service.
,Jamie,5,I've experienced very satisfied service. The lady who helped me to process a package was very sweet and professional. Excellent Post Office in my town! Thank you for your amazing service. 🙂👍👍
,jignesh goti,1,"Do I have the option of giving zero stars???

I generally don't write any harsh words for any business.
I sent my passport for stamping to Ottawa. They charged $38 ( no offense).
But when you pay such a healthy amount.
As a customer I expect to get correct information.
They didn't guide me to take a picture of the returning envelope at all.

Now I am just hoping to get my passport back. And they dont have any information for that.

I would never be happy to visit such an  (untrained) representative offered service."
,Anastasia VLS,5,Just received a great customer service from Mohini. Appreciate her help.
,Neha Neha,1,"The lady working today January 12 2021, at 4.40. Very rude and not helpful. She does not deserve to be in customer service.
I came to drop off the package which was already paid off. And I always avoid to come to this location people are so waste of time.
But j took my chance again. The line was so huge and she had such a wrong and egoistic attitude which upset me so much. Someone must take of her before she ruin canad post reputation. Best locations and customer service is at chinguacousy and sandalwood or sandalwood and Dixie.
Will never come here agian"
,vivian gray,4,"great customer service!! only thing is that it can be slow sometimes with only one working person, but they always get another person if the line is really long!"
,Azeem anif,1,"The person at the counter of Canada post is extremely slow, a turtle moves faster. Very disappointing i was expecting better service. Is this what it comes down to."
,Hemantkumar Vaghela,1,Very bad behaviour of person named John. Not giving response properly and his behaviour is very weird like just stand up their to return everyone with any reason. Behaving like his private store and not Canada post.
,sarabjeet singh,1,"The note they left at house says store open till 9pm on Friday however I arrive dstore at 0803 pm and they says we close at 8pm.. even if it closes at 8pm , they laxk courtesy"
,Austin Boucinha,1,"The worst Canada Post location in Brampton by far. It’s so frustrating that all my undelivered packages end up here because it means that I have to deal with the poor positioning of this location and the incredibly rude and lazy staff that work here.

Also, if you’re going to have your employees take breaks @CanadaPost, that’s perfectly well and good, but make sure you have someone covering the front desk at all times! There’s absolutely no reason why taxpayers should need to be waiting upwards of 30 minutes at the location to be served. Can’t even believe this is an issue in the first place, what a joke!"
,Ishpal Singh,1,I wish i can give zero star. The lady behind the counter is so rude. Management needs to see this and she needs to be replaced.
,Hero Certified Burgers Derry & McLaughlin,1,"Avoid this location at all cost. I had to complete a verification process for opening a bank account with ""Simplii Financial""which simply turned out to be the most painful and complicated process of opening a bank account. The bank emailed me a letter with a barcode and some instructions to follow as part of the requirements to verify my identification.  The letter clearly states that a valid providential driver license is sufficient enough to complete the verification process. I took my driver license and the barcode to this post office,  but I was denied by the man with British/ Scottish accent behind the counter for a ""simple"" verification process. He wanted me to show him a mail or bank statement which also shows my residential address even though I had already provided him my valid government ID showing my residential address which was my driver license. I told him the letter that he was scanning shows a different instruction, but he said he didn't care. He didn't even bother to even read it. I asked him if he could clarify that from his end becuase that letter wasn't from a small online merchant . According to the email I received, Simplii fincacial( CIBC's banks subsidiary)  partnered up with Canada post and they would be sending the same instructions to millions of others potential clients....  all he kept saying was, he didn't care and why I didn't carry my insurance policy with me... I asked for his supervisor and showed her the letter, but she also tried to justify his requirement by saying the Canada Post system asked them for such requirements.....

I had never been required  for a proof of my address while providing my valid driver license which already has my address. I carry a mail with my address when I need to show  government IDs like my passport which has no address on it .... common sense. I told him I could show him my passport if there is two peices of IDs required as it is also a common practice for the banks, but he wanted me to show him a  mail with my address. This is the first time I'm requested for such a strength thing at a post office. Since when we are ignoring the legitimacy of the government IDs and look for authenticity of a bill?

I finally called Canada post customer service and the rep confirmed  that I didn't have to provide a secondary mail address as a proof of my address when  my driver license was valid. Non of the two staff I dealt with had any clue with the standard requirements and I ended up wasting my time because the man had his own theory of verification.  I filed a complaint about this location so no one else is gonna waste their time and energy like I did.

Do yourself a favor and avoid this location at all cost."
,Jessica Till,5,Great spot to pick up fun gifts - especially for kids! My go-to shop for Squishmallows! The staff couldn’t be nicer!

,kuro,1,The older Asian gentlemen during the evening was not trained properly on using QR code shipping label and attempted to charge me for using the service. When I asked if he could confirm with a supervisor or head office he tried to direct me to the Rexall manager who is not in charge of the Canada post kiosk. Left to go to Canada post at a Shoppers location and got confirmation from staff that they should not charge for QR code shipping label and also process the package for you on the spot.
,Romana Huq,4,Always had good patient service from the Canada Post associates.  It's a demanding position so let's be fair.  Keep up the good work!
,AMIT SHARMA 9,1,"UNPROFESSIONALISM , I called over phone can i send my letter from here and when arrived 1 hour before closing time black lady at counter said she cant accept my post, when i told i talked before coming, she accepted.What was that?

,Emily S,5,The older Asian gentleman is polite and professional. Never had any issues at this location. Tape isn’t expensive! Go to Dollarama and buy your own tape. Have your returns ready to go. End of story!
,Usman USI,5,Never encountered any wait times. Good service and speedy transactions. Would recommend. It’s inside of Rexall.
,Krutang Patel,5,"I had a fantastic experience at Canada Post today when I visited to return an Amazon order. The staff member who assisted me, Lubna, was incredibly polite and helpful throughout the entire process. She went above and beyond to ensure that my package was securely packed and ready for shipping. Her dedication to customer service was impressive, and I felt confident that my package was in good hands.
Thank you for the outstanding experience!"
,Kaila Mervin,1,"I tried to ship something out and had the wrong label, no big deal but the lady working, black lady not sure her name was very rude from the start of our interaction. She didn’t explain things properly  to me and was rushing trying to charge me for things before even explaining to me what was happening. It was a horrible experience, made me feel anxious to the point where i had to leave and head to a different location. She also had her headphone in the whole time. Super unprofessional."
,radhika maggi,1,"I’ve had worst experience in this store , there’s a black lady who work evenings in this canada post … she’s extremely rude for no reason , not at all helpful , extremely unprofessional shouting and loud for no reason . Instead of helping she makes others seem like they’re dumb , she just shouts saying “I don’t know what you’re talking about “…. Seems like she’s not willing to work. I don’t understand why she’s working there at first place if she hates her job that much !!
Very disappointed… No etiquette, no sense nothing .
Eventually had to head to other location… this was second time in a row … she’s good for nothing ."
,krunal patel,1,Senseless service. One of the lady doesn't have any respect towards customers. Literally felt like a garbage service. Always gives improper answer in bad manner. I would say 0 start out of 5. No recommendation at all. This one star is just to post review. Otherwise I would give lowest one.
,bill Mewho,2,"I've seen there are mixed reviews, good and bad, and that is how I experience myself also.  It is so depends who is working there. Having a short distance from my home, I get many items delivered here, as well as  mailing my items there. I've met nice people working there, and that is probably why the office gets the good  reviews (for them I should give 4-5 stars), but there is one particular person for which 1 star is too much. I have sent several letters which were at the limit for thickness, 19.5 mm, limit is 20 mm. As long as it pass the slot should be good. I've send several identical shape letters from different locations, and also from this office, but when this person is working refuses to send no matter what. Her name is Sonia, and has horrible customer service skills. For her sanity, for  the clients going there, for the Canada Post reputation, it should be much better if would take a job where doesn't need to deal with people."
,Luda Murr,2,"I am feeling like being harassed by someone at the office!
I use CP FlexDelivery service to pick up my items at the local office as there is no-one to answer the door during the day. Lately, someone at the PO started inundating me with paper-cards sending 2 per each item right away to my home address. The delivery apparently takes time, and, the cards arrive way after I pick my items. I stop by regularly and asked numerous times not to send the cards - to no avail. Someone is having fun and doesn't concern herself with the associated costs nor disturbance this causes."
,Joshua Wasswa,5,"no clue what the other people are saying about wait times, every time i go there is no line up and the person is either around the corner or right there. i did a pick up there and i was fast and easy, an employee stopped stocking a shelf to politely help me. glad its close to my house well be coming back for sure"
,Gurleen Kaur,1,Bad Attitude!!!! Customer Service = 0
,Eliza I,1,"Horrible!
For the amount of money we get charged we should at least be entitled to tape. Because that's one thing we don't have on us!
They don't have tape at all, I wonder how do they tape the boxes? With a glue stick!?
Not to mention their speed!!!!!!"
,Info Acb Canada,1,It's 9.30 no one at desk. Supposed to be open 9 am. Another public run company where service is in gutter.
,Michael Ballard,5,"I had several very positive experiences at this location over many years. It is a VERY busy location, so bring your patience and your manners. Some of the other customers can be curt and rude. Imagine one customer counting out over $7.00 in nickels, dimes and quarters  in lose change while over 20 of us waited in line."
,Sara Lee,1,Inaccurate description. If you close at 8 then don’t say it’s 9. I was stopped at the door at 8:05pm and was told no one would be at the desk.
,Samarth Saxena,1,"Very very unhelpful and insensitive staff. While accepting the package they’ll give you fake promises of delivery date and after that they would take U turn. While accepting my shipment to India, they guaranteed me 3 business days and now it’s been 3 days without any tracking update. When I visited them, they said we don’t know anything and delays are normal. Wow! Pathetic post office! Beware! Manager and all staff have bad attitude."
,Matthew Ma,1,I would give 0 star if possible charge 50cents for the QR code which no other location does. Money monger location
,RAMIN GULIYEV,1,"This post office closing at 8:00 pm (visited today on Monday 8:00pm) but in their website and google page aren’t updated yet. Wasted time because of that, even written on the notice stickers closing time at 9 pm."
,candice marshall,1,There is a very disrespectful so called women there name Armela if you get her as a cashier she is so unprofessional she treats customers like her dog she disowns. Please hire better staff thank you. For one she does not even say hello. She comes with attitude chewing her gum. Then when you are handing her money she barely budges out her hand to receive the money. Last time I was there about a week ago I got her as a cashier and same situation. That’s why this time I had to speak up. She laughed as I told her to she said I was “waiting” that’s her excuse as to why she didn’t put her hand out she literally held her hand close to her stomach. So I have to lean over the counter to hand her the money???? That’s what she was “waiting” for ? Really terrible excuse what are u waiting for I first held the money out and when I noticed she wasn’t budging I had to lean forward to put it in her hand. This is not customer service this is beyond unprofessional. She has to go she doesn’t say hello or how are you just super rude.
,JE MA,2,"Absurdly long line ups. Despite people waiting a long time, only one SUPER SLOW staff member oblivious to people waiting.This post office is infuriating. Hie more staff. Hire better staff."
,Melissa Sinclair,1,"There should be more mail drop boxes in my neighborhood! I live at Dundas and Mabelle. There's no box for putting my mail to send out in at all around here. Unless I walk 1000 feet , which I can't due to being disabled."
,Onemore Snottyyoutubeopinion,1,"When I went in yesterday (Sunday morning), there was a line of clients spanning across 4 aisles in Shopper's. Typical of the Post Office, there was one employee working. If you like under-staffed with long line ups this is the post office location for you. I simply walked out. Lining up for over an hour to send one letter by ExpressPost is just absurd."
,Joonwoo,2,"In despite of handing over the shipment to clerk at this post office, my shipment has never been scanned for the update and potentially got lost in transit. Scanning Barcode of the shipment is simple task and only take less than 10 second of their time to before put in the Bin. It was a mid aged white lady who worked on Sept 15th 2021 7:55pm, I know exact time of drop since I was rushing in to make it before office being closed.

Furthermore, I followed up with CP customer service, they will investigate and resolve this case by Oct 12th which is 1 month away from now.

People should make sure to see if clerk is scanning your item. Don't get comfortable and trust this people doing their job right.

I send out multiple shipments for business so using this office frequently, and I am satisfied with Asian men and women works during the day time they are helpful. But this happen for the first time when I drop off my package at the evening and other clerk was there."
,Simon W,4,Located inside the Shopper Drugmart in the back corner by the food. Very busy around 5pm when everyone finishes work. They only had 1 person working so be prepared to wait. Staff was friendly and processed everything correctly.
,Gerald M,3,Sadly the reviews are accurate. Long lines as the demographic of customers range from very frail seniors to young folks. Thought I’d try this location but it’s a long wait. Seniors do love chatting with the agents at the front reception of this canada post location. Recommend detouring to another location if you are unable to wait at least 15 minutes or longer.
,Ashish Sharma,5,"Contrary to all the reviews here, i went yesterday for delivering a package at canada post around 2pm and it took around 2 mins to get the work done. The lady at the counter was also helpful. Maybe it depends on what time you go there"
,Mika Hamilton,1,"Waited 75 minutes in line to drop off a return package. There’s only one computer/register for a busy downtown location, and I see multiple reviews stating the same issue of very long waits. I’m surprised this hasn’t been addressed."
,colin menezes,5,"Had a great experience at this Canada Post outlet. The gentleman behind the counter has a lot of experience and is precise and diligent in his work. The outlet is amazing, and has everything that you need right from stamps to collectors coins and all kinds of packing boxes etc. I had gone twice, once for a gift card and then again to get a reloadable Visa card. I also got rolls of stamps and everything that I needed was readily available. Service was quick too. When I reached there were 4 people infront of me and yet I was done and out from there on less than 10mins. This place is truely a neighborhood friendly post office."
,Your Honest Reviewer,5,"Although this Canada Post location can sometimes be hit or miss, I received exceptional service from Naveed this past Saturday. I had to show proof of identification to receive a criminal background check, and the process was done in under 5 minutes. However, I did have to wait over 20 minutes, as it's common for staff to take frequent breaks at this location. Other than that, I really want to thank Naveed, as he is super friendly and helpful."
,Landy Shu,1,Worst experience ever! The man who work on Tuesday afternoon and wearing glasses is so rude and also  discrimination. Before us is white man and he offered very good service and polite but he treated us very impatient because of we had yellow face?we just want return a package. That’s it!!!  his attitude make my friends and me felt very discomfort. This place was my first time come and would be last time.I’m so disappointed with Canada post in this place.
,Ling Kao,2,2022.09.09 - breached retail contractual agreement with Canada Post by remaining closed during outlined Canada Post retail operating hours. Closures occurring on numerous occasions conflicting with Canada Post hours of operation. Store Associate/Head Pharmacist risks losing Canada Post postal outlet and significant revenue loss.
,Thanuja V,1,Worst experience ever. First time returning clothing items so I was not sure how to ship it. I brought the original box the clothes were in and did not tape it. I asked the man for tape and he told me to buy it. Why would I spend $3 on tape just for one box. Waste of time . Extremely BAD EXPERIENCE knowing this is Canada Post running this. So ashamed in the service . Definitely going to UPS next time .
,Anastasia,2,"Is it acceptable for post office workers to have a break at any time? It would be great if they mentioned their break hours if they are longer than 10 minutes, so that the customers can plan their time. I needed to pick up my parcel which takes couple of minutes, but I had to wait for 35 instead."
,Garry hundal,5,"The lady Magzina is super helpful what she did for me nobody want to do for a customer
I forgot to renew my PO Box and that allotted to someone else she requested to that person and give it back to me …thanx magzina"
,Aanchal Punia,5,"A lady named magZina... She is gem💎. She helped me and one of my friend in TRV passport request.
Keep supporting like this.
Thankyou.."
,Hardik Joshi,5,"If you have any work related to Canada Post, I highly recommend visiting this post office. Magzina is very kind and helpful."
,GIREESH KAKUTURU,5,"They are super friendly, especially Magzina, wonderful woman. sincerely appreciate your efficient, gracious customer service.
I appreciate the help you gave me today."
,vivek kapoor,5,"I posted a registered letter today and lost my tracking receipt etc. I traced my steps back but couldn't find the receipt. I had the most amazing experience with Post Canada employee "" Magzina"" who not only helped me with my tracking details but also gave a photocopy of my envelope. She was busy, but efficient and compassionate. Thanks and God bless you!"
,Dancerneverstop,1,I am driving all the way with heavy package to handover to this Canada Post branch and see this notice - why there is a time break for none service during the working hours!l?!  You close by 5pm why you cut time period out of service without letting customers knowing in advance?! Very lazy staff!
,he bi,1,"There is a white trashy girl working there today (July 15, Sat), who is extremally rude and indifferent and lazy. She refused to even move the package from the weighing scale to her storage room and request myself to do it for her. She said it's too heavy - god it's just a mid size package and I'm a person skimmer than her - how come I can do it but she couldn't?!  Especially it is her job to do that!!  Let alone she always disappear from her duty during working hours!!! She is the worst Canada Post staff I have ever seen - Canada Post or Shoppers should FIRE her right away!  Indeed withe trash!"
,John Smith,1,"They lost a parcel I dropped off a month ago and never took responsibility even trying to resolve the problem, just asking the unexpected customer to contact the receiver or even show evidence of being there, the worst shipping experience in my life!!"
,Sahar Aurora,1,"I think you need to take Canada Post out of this Shoppers, because it is useless. It says it is open until 9 pm and when you get there, it is closed. There was literally one person at the store and I had a hard time finding her. She told me oh yeah the staff called in sick!
I was reading other reviews. Seems like this is not the first time it is happening. I am going to let Canada Post know about this location, because there is a reason you are there and that is to serve people. This way you are ruining Canada Post’s reputation."
,L Z,1,I went to the outlet to drop off an Amazon return package. An asian guy worked there told me that I needed to buy the tape there for him to process the package. Never had the problem before so I just went to another Canada post down the street and got the package processed in minutes (actually only less than 10 inch of tape was needed to seal the box).
,Harry in Downtown,1,"The staff do not know how to print out the label which was created and paid by client. He ask we go somewhere to print it out. Finally, he use photocopy machine to take label on my phone screen. Disappointed service compare with another location of Canada Post"
,Blake Wallace,1,"Everytime I come to this location I have to wait upwards of 20 mins, it’s gotten absurd."
,J G,5,"Friendly staff, always help me find best value on shipping rates.
Line up can be long but that is common at most CP locations"
,THUNDER CLOUD,5,"This Canada Post Office inside Shoppers is convienienltly located.
♿ Accesible enrtrance at the corner of Queen Street East & Parliament Street on South side of Queen Street in Historic Corktown.
Although it is at the back right hand corner inside Shoppers.
I have found the customer service & handling courteously all good.
The service my family & local residence have used for years in addition to mine for personal mail as well as for other business purposes we have been pleased with.They also sell stamps at the Post Office counter.
Envelopes & other items you may need for mailing to the left of the counter. I noticed the employees are hard working & handling mail arriving in a timely way. The small if any line ups at all prove they got this all moving quite well.

,Joel Rose,5,"I've been there many times and haven't had any issues. The guy tonight (Jin?) was friendly and dropped everything to assist me. There's parking, which is helpful if you're picking up big heavy items. I use this as my Amazon pickup point."
,Keith Ver,5,"Very courteous and fast service! The staff are nice and will gladly accommodate your queries!

Just a tip tho, when you get a delivery notice, make sure to call them first before you go there. Sometimes your package might not be with them yet so it pays to check first."
,Jooye kwok,5,"Love this Canada Post location - every time I have been here, I have been helped thoroughly. I had to call in one time to ask one of the staff members to look up something manually for me (essentially, she had to go through a long list of transactions to find mine), and not only was the staff member successful in finding what I needed, she was SO friendly. Despite the location getting really busy at times with customers, the staff members are so efficient and friendly. Highly recommend!"
,Andreas Lerch,2,Honestly I wouldn’t have given 2 stars if the teller didn’t give me a hard time about giving me a piece of tape to attach the packing label to the parcel. I realize this is not a free for all packing service. My parcel was packaged all I needed was a piece of tape to attach the shipping label to the package. Not a big deal I already paid 28$ to ship it. Please pick and choose your tape battles. I would totally have understood if I was trying to wrap a whole package up. Rant over.
,Md Shohel RanaXp,1,I'm sorry say that deliver person didn't call me for home delivery. He just give a notice card to collect it from post office wich was far away from my home. It took my 2 hrs of valuable time and Taxi took me $24. It could have solved on the 1st day just giving a min phone call. :(
,Steve gobbo,5,"Good fast service, regardless who is working behind to counter.  I go there too many times, but they seem to be ok with me.   Darcy is the best!"
,Mei owo,1,"I’ve been going here alot because it is in the neighbourhoods. The women that work here has no respect and manners. I can’t understand why they speak and treat customers in such aggressive tone. (As if we are filthy) They cant seem to know how to interact with customer’s in respectful manners.

Whenever I go drop off a package. I always speak in low tone and respectful. In exchange they confront with aggressive, rude attitude. It make me uncomfortable to speak. The workers here has no customer skills and unprofessional. I would recommend to avoid this place."
,Patrick Maberry,1,"I was here today and the lady working didn’t had any compassion. They refused to give me my packages. They told me my ID was expired, and who knew photo ID’s even expired. I was nice and show them my student ID, name on Credit Card, and even a photo of my passport on my phone to make sure they knew it was me. They still refused telling me it was company policy. I understand policy but some people need to have compassion and make one time exceptions for good customer service.

Driver should had deliver on my door tho, but they decided to drop here."
,M M,1,The woman who works at the post office is SO RUDE and UNKIND and NO CUSTOMER SERVISE SKILL what soever. I forgot to check her name but she always BOSSY and RUDE  I normally avoid this post office because she makes me soo uncomfortable. She should not be working if she doesnt know how to treat customers.
,Anna Rebodos,5,I brought in 2 packages to be sent to the US at 8 a.m. today. The postal clerk on duty was extremely helpful. I am a senior and the least bit tech savvy. She assisted me in filling up the customs forms and gave me tips on reducing postal charges. I am in awe of how amazing she was.
,Laura Kittar,1,"If I could rate zero stars I would. The women who work at Canada Post are absolutely sour and miserable. Unwilling to assist, combative when you ask them questions, and overall just a horrible customer service experience. I had a large package to pick up - that Canada post didn’t even attempt to drop off at my house (I was home all day) - and the staff were rude and unhelpful in the process of pick up. Skip this location unless you want your day ruined."
,Stephanie Woods,5,The man that helped me sort out mail forwarding after my mom passed was so patient and kind. I have always had friendly service here!
,Zareef Houston,5,Best customer service out of Canada post that I've been to. William and his co-workers rock!
,PAWAN MADANKAR,1,"Rude, unhelpful staff couldn't figure out how to print out a shipping label , take long lunch breaks as customers to wait , never saw such service anywhere really horrible"
,Angela Y,1,"Came in on a Sunday and hours of operation state they're open until 5PM. I came in at 4:30PM and they already had the gates closed. The clerk said she was closed for the day. I understand if I came in at 4:50, but you still have half an hour before your posted closing time. Updating your hours would be greatly appreciated to save people an unnecessary trip."
,basedomg,5,The guy that works afternoons there is a legend. Can’t remember his name but he’s featured in the photos above. He’s extremely knowledgeable and efficient and just an all around beauty.
,Nyuri A,5,"I just had one of the best experiences at Canada Post. The male officer (I think his first name starts with J and T for his last name? He looked like Keir Gilchrist anyways) was so helpful and nice to not just me, to every single customer, obviously. Thanks to him, my first online shipping went smoothly. I hope there's always an offer like him at every Canada Post lol"
,India M. Clamp,3,"Review in progress...
At first I stopped at the liquor store as the location was somewhat unclear. In California most post offices are stand alone locations (Canada Post located inside a retail store) what a nice surprise.

Nice to meet you today Zenny. I appreciate the help in learning all about Canada Post. The two kind offerings are appreciated/unexpected. Liked the ""We do not Rush in Canada"" quote.

I was advised as to how long it would take for items to arrive and it was communicated how to properly address  (given end destination). Letters posted and anticipating the response."
,Nick Wimpney,1,"They refused to give me a package with our company name on it without a business card as ID.  I went back to the office and got a business card from the office manager, but then they refused to give it to me because my drivers license doesn't match the business card (because business cards are ID, right?)

This isn't ""signature required"", or ""Delivery only to the recipient"".  They usually just leave them in our lobby where anyone walking by could steal them, but then today we've got to jump through hoops to get our package."
,Ray Abedin,5,"Hi I have 2 post cards I sent out on March 13 but didn't write the addresses can you please contact me if you still have them, I can provide address"
,Mikau Seafox,1,"Canada Post has twice returned a parcel to the sender that I had ordered weeks ago on the basis that my apartment in Surrey is an ""invalid address"". I had been living in the same apartment for 5 years, and someone I live with has been receiving parcels from them and Purolator with far less issues than mine. Quite possibly the worse postal service in the country, bar none."
,Cora Penaflorida,1,"I was in this outlet yesterday, June 04 at 4:35PM. I was the 4th person in line. At 4:46, the store clerk said that she is closing. I was next in line. I told her why she did not announce it. She claims that she did. I was mailing something that requires a tracking number, Just as I was about to leave, the person behind me said that she is just there to pick up something. The store clerk said yes to her. What is the difference with serving a customer mailing a letter vs a customer picking up something.
I never minded the long line at this outlet but the kind of service given yesterday was UNACCEPTABLE.
People come to this outlet because it is the only one in the area. I hope another outlet opens in the area so that less people would come to this outlet.
I put ONE STAR but this outlet deserves ZERO STAR"
,Whitney Bee,5,"As a small business, I’m always at Canada Post shipping out parcels.

I’ve tried many locations but the staff at this location are extremely fast and efficient even when there’s always a line up here during peak times. Every single Canada Post staff member here is professional and patient when you need to ask them a question.

They don’t overcharge packages and usually provides a solution for you to save money unlike some Canada Post outlets."
,Jana Evans,5,"Best post office employees ever. Last night the guy there, not sure what his name is, has a light beard helped a lot to send my package the cheapest way. The post office was busy but he was multitasking helping me and serving other customer in a meantime while I was packing my stuff or filling up the form. He was very friendly, efficient and fast. Honestly I am buying him a gift card next time."
,Hannah taki,1,"Most of staff members seem to provide amazing customer services.
But unfortunately one of member who is a middle age lady and has Chinese accent might need some kind of trainings of customer service.
Her way of saying is a kind of tricky and sounds quite rude."
,Praveen Pious,5,Visited this place to send two mails to USA. The employee was courteous and helped me send the mails. I didn't have any spare envelops with me but the employee loaned me two envelopes for a nominal rate. Wanted tracking to be included in the mail and it was also done without any issues. Thank you for the wonderful service.
,Maria W,3,"I’ve been going here for like a decade and it’s been pretty mediocre in service. There was a short older Asian lady at the counter working mornings who always seemed to be in a bad mood and whenever I asked her anything she would basically shout back the answer at me like I was stupid. The older Asian man hasn’t been that rude to me, but he’s just really slow and seems kind of miserable. Haven’t had any trouble with any of the other staff, but the evening people seem to sometimes take their lunch without someone to cover for them, and leave a sign up “will be back in 30 minutes”. Not sure if she still works there but there was one young lady who was excellent with customers. White lady with brown hair. Super nice and super helpful when you had a problem. There were a couple times that I went in the next business day after 1 pm to get my package and it wasn’t at the post office yet. I would recommend going 2 or 3 business days after receiving your door knocker, just to be sure."
,Cindy Tang,4,"The staff is professional. I usually just drop off package there, so they process it really fast. However there is always a long line and the customers before me always take extremely long time. Since there is social distance measures and people have mask required so I don’t mind that much wait inline :)"
,レーレーヴィ,1,"Worst location.
Employees could take a course in customer service.
Staff is condescending and rude.
They outright blame Canada Post about their notification showing that packages are ready for pick up being fake and should wait a day or until you get a reminder.

How lazy is that when you see them have no customers and a pile of packages to scan in, they’re instead standing around gossiping.

Do a full circle of Shoppers to not interrupt them and nope, they’re still gossiping and get mad at you for interrupting.

The senior Asian lady with the long wavy hair is the worst."
,Randy MacPhee,5,"A lot of people say this location is really bad. Just went here today, the lady working, Padma, was great! Quick, friendly, and professional."
,Julia Penwarden,5,"I attended this RPO yesterday to do a Telus return…no return label or instructions from Telus!  Clerk took the parcel, printed a label, gave me a receipt with the tracking number (which he explained) and told me to have a good day!"
,Nicky Lee,5,Great customer service. Nice clean place. It's an official Canada post office. Hours are better than other ones.
,B L,1,"Worst customer service ever! I’ve been here many time, never had a good experience"
,Kay X,1,The Chinese lady working on Sundays do not know how to multitask. Told me that they do not allow drop offs and asked me to go back of the line and then had the customers become outraged?! All postal offices allow prepaid drop offs. All you need to do is scan them when you have the chance.
,Ali Farokhi,1,"The employe in this branch played with me . I paid 50 dollars for overnight service to toronto and my document didnt arrived yet. It has been 3 days. I have a container in delta port which I needed to release . Now 3 days equall to 600 dollars late pick up . I am not sure who is going to be responsible for my damage.  This is the worse service I have ever seen .
Dont go there . They play with you ."
,Katherine Scrimshaw,1,"The service is wildly unreliable. I've been there several times when no one was manning the counter. On three occasions I was told the person who was supposed to be working didn't show up. Many, many times I've stood in a long line up for 20 minutes waiting for someone to get off a break. I only use this location when I have no other option."
,jw zale,1,"There is a guy with hat working here very unfriendly and impatient, can't ask him any questions. Seems he is always busy with his own stuff and no desired to respond you with questions. He seems not like Chinese people, and don't want to waste time on them"
,Alexander Leung,5,"TLDR:
Fast and helpful service that gets the job done well.

Main Express Review:
I live in the area and this is my go to Canada Post. The experiences that I’ve had coming over 10+ time over the past year have all been pleasant. I’ve been to other places and I’ve experienced issues such at language barriers, unhelpful / stressed employees, closures without notice.

Many times I’ve been here they’ve spent extra time to help people that cannot read directions to save their firstborn. Quite impressed with how they deal with customers like these all day without ripping all their hair out.

What do you want with a Canada post?
Marine Express has it.
1. Fast. Tick.
2. Reliable. Tick.
3. Patient, helpful and offers solutions to your shipping problems. Tick.
4. Plenty of FREE parking nearby. Tick

The shop isn’t the cleanest as there’s another repair business operating in the same unit but this Canada Post has their business together.

They deserve more love for what they put in. Would definitely recommend this location to others.

I’ve always been helped by Philip. Cool guy w/ heart in this game. You’ll notice him."
,Karena T,1,Please ensure you update your hours on Google. Came last Thurs at 1pm and the store was closed. Came today (Monday) at 1pm and store was closed again. Both times google said the store would be open.
,nicole,2,Okay location. Person providing service was quick but unfriendly. Only come here out of convenience/proximity. Prefer the SDM/London Drugs Canada Post offices
,Sam Jaspar,5,Extremely helpful and quick service.
,Andrea Papp,1,"This location is permanently closed. The closest post office is now at Hastings and Kaslo.

Despite informing Google that this location is closed, including photos, they refuse to delist it from Maps or mark as permanently closed.

Rest assured, 711 and CP have terminated their contract and this location is indeed closed."
,Sibylle Stipp,1,This location CLOSED since March 2023 - Canada Post has not updated online link to state CLOSED
,Chucho Godinez (GasparIlom),1,"Post office is closed at this location, the people working at the 7-11 were not very helpfull when I asked where was the nearest Post Office."
,Michelle Baudais,1,This location is closed.  I visited today and there is no longer a post office in the 7-11 at First and Nanaimo.
,Alex Dan,1,I attempted to give this location business. They want $43 Canadian to ship a parcel. I needed a strip or two of boxing tape for the parcel. I was told by the employee I must buy a roll of boxing tape. Because they’re a privatized location. I did not give them my business instead. I’ve been to dozens of other locations that don’t mind helping out by giving a strip of tape. No customer courtesy at this location
,hammy pie,5,"My favorite post office! The lady there is always super friendly and helpful to me. She advises me when to use the Canada Post flat rate box and when to not. There's sometimes a line, but the service is fast and efficient so it's probably the customer's issue having complicated requests."
,Nicky Lee,5,I really like their customer service here. I ship a lot here as it is one of the closer Canada Posts around.  They always are willing to help and save you money by offering you the best options.  What else can you ask for.
,Sabrina T,1,*Refused my packages*. Is this a real post office? The male staff questioned me if I'm a business(I'm not) when I tried to drop off 5 packages and he said they don't accept business packages and asked me to go to other locations! Is there a sign say no business packages accepted? Is that a written policy or personal preference? However I saw a full bin of business flyers on their table lol
,Kseniya Soldatenko,5,"This is one of my favorite locations. 1st of all, it's the closest post office to my home. And 2d of all, the service is usually very fast. I ship about once avery 1-2 weeks and don't remember having any problem at this location. FYI mail pick up time for this location is usually around 4pm on business days. So I try to bring my mail before that time to catch the mail pick up."
,fanny ling,1,"I went to ship a parcel but didn’t have a box so I purchased a box there. It was clearly a used box that they were reusing, but i still payed nearly 5$ for it. When I politely asked for tape to close the box, the front lady rolled her eyes and asked why I didn’t tape it in advance/bring my own tape. How in the world am I supposed to tape it “in advance” if I bought the box on the spot??? Well she ended up charging me $1 for the tape, which I wouldn’t have been as offended if she wasn’t so sarcastic. Don’t go there. The one on oak&42nd is so much more professional and friendly."
,A KL,1,"Busy location with long line ups. They don’t communicate with people standing in line. I got to the front after waiting 30 minutes. Was told to step aside and go online to file a customs form and come back. Did that and was told by one sour faced agent to go to the back of line again. Waited another 15 minutes until the other much more pleasant and helpful agent came and took me out of the line to get my parcel sorted. She gets the star on this review.

With all the moaning and groaning Canada Post does about other shipping carriers taking their revenue and the difficult keeping Canada post workers employed -  I had two options to send two small items worth $20 to the UK. Pay $50 for air or $26 for surface which takes two months and no tracking. Never again will I ship anything nationally or internationally using Canada Post. Absolute disgrace."
,Anand Arungundram Mohan,5,"Brenda L was very helpful even though I was taking a long time to get my new debit card to work. She was professional and got the work done perfectly. I wish her the best and kudos for being so helpful to customers till the issue got resolved. I took a money order here, and it is less expensive than even what banks charge."
,HandbagBeast,1,"The workers are not helpful always. I see long queue outside London drugs because service is slow, even only 1 worker on front desk.  You can see other staff not give a hand. Personally I experienced the staff sent me away to find a cardboard inside London drugs which is not an appropriate method for my document ending up I spent 1 hour for my mail. The second time the guy sent me away again as he said my parcel has not arrived yet. I doubt if it was true. I wish the management should look into the attitude of your staff."
,dmg luxury,1,"Everytime I come and drop an item there , they just look at you. No acknowledgement, no thank you ,No greetings, no smiley faces unlike other canada post office . I know this location is busy but customer service is really bad , no feelings lol"
,JiMi S,1,"It was definitely the worst service experience in my life. I wanted to send a parcel internationally. Line up was long. I waited for 30mins. When I got to the counter, the clerk said you need to do online registry thing. (The grey unnoticeable sign about this new system was stood next to the line up but the French side was facing toward the people.) So I went to the website and they want you to register an account(+email verification) and you need to measure your parcel. But I  put some approximate numbers because I don’t have a ruler and a scale. After all the hard work, I came to counter again and the clerk said I need to cancel it and do it again because I put wrong numbers. She just measured it for validation, not for the original purpose. Anyway I gave up because I even if I pass this whole process by myself the charge was extremely expensive and delivery takes at least a month (maybe 3!). It’s shame to be named ‘Canada Post’."
,Sasan,1,Unprofessional people in this post office. They need proof of the address from Ontario which I lived 2 years ago to fwd my mails to BC . Proof of my ID and my current address were not enough for them to fwd my mails. Mails are under my name I don't understand why they need proof of the address from ON for 2 years ago. I have updated my documents to BC.
,Cuisin Art,5,Have been using this location since moving to the neighborhood in 2019. Always friendly and helpful staff. Great place to pick up your Amazon shipment and do a return. Lots of help when using MoneyGram
,Nikko Wong,1,Do not trust this post office location.  Dropped off amazon return right into hands of postal clerk and it didn't even get initial scan.  Lost my return. Never had issue with pre paid Amazon drop offs at any other Canada Post location
,Kristina Patterson,5,"Friendly, fast-service, and an overall good experience. I used to go to the post office in  Madison Centre (closer to me) however, the extra distance is totally worth it! Goes to show just how important having good customer service is. I keep coming back to this location."
,Jen Moxin,5,I've been to this location two or three times. The staff was very kind and patient.
,sandeep kaur,1,"worst service . The lady who is working there is so rude, dont even try to guide people like what to do or which envelope they required. she knows nothing about customer service.
A long waiting line. work could be done earlier we they try to help and give information at first time rather than behaving like customer must know everything."
,Ruqayyah Mohammed,1,Horrible service and the Asian man is rude. Idk his name but all the other staff are very nice but he’s horrible to speak with. He closes early before hours. Just keep that in mind if you have to come to this location.
,sagar saini,1,"The lady there, was so unprofessional and have no sense to deal with customers. She was talking rudely with bad attitude. Never going again there. She don’t even guide customers for parcel process. Wasting my two parcel envelope, in last she said this is incorrect and not acceptable."
,Rajveer Sekhon,1,"I wish it had 0 star option , I probably give that. The lady working is extremely rude and she doesn't give you full information to what to do to send a parcel. I am wondering who hired her as a front desk associate while she has no clue how to do her job."
,Molly Mangat,1,I sent package last month to India and the delivery guy said he needs money first only then he can give the package. I sent $150 and then they took Rs 2600. Reason behind the money was taxes.
,Danielle Ryan,1,"I don’t think I’ve ever had a worse Canada Post experience. The woman working here is unbelievably rude. My partner and I came in to confirm our identities for mail forwarding as we are moving. We had a few questions about how the process works and wanted confirmation that I would in fact be included in the mail forwarding to which she had no willingness to give an answer. I have worked many years in customer service facing roles and have patience for people who work in positions where they are likely to be berated all day and become frustrated, but this was 9am and the day had only begun. Would recommend you go elsewhere for your postal needs"
,Moises Schini,4,"I really like this Canada Post location. It’s very convenient, not too busy and the staff is always friendly. There’s a underground parking lot which charges $2.50 for one hour but they refund ir for minimum purchases of $5."
,Aaron Nakama,1,"One pays for parking, you get inside and yet no one is at the counter, at different hours throughout the day.

This is my 4th time here, and each time there’s been a sign saying “The post office will re-open at X:XX... so either you’re open during posted hours, or just close it down altogether."
,Sade Leschuk,1,I went to ship a package the other day and the lady kept on trying to convince me to go with the most expensive option because it has insurance coverage up to $100. In the past I have always folded my item to be the smallest possible which is what i did i’ve saved $2 per package by doing this because it takes out all of the air. After doing this the lady literally expanded my package therefore charging me more making the package carrying cloth pants to a location an hour and a half away $20
,Dina W,1,"I went there Saturday (8th of August 2020) to send an important envelope and the open hours meant 10.00-18.00. I was there 1.40 pm and to find out, someone took a break for more than an hour. The sign on the counter showed a reopen time at 2.50 pm. It's unbelievable. A washroom break for 5 min I can understand, but a lunch break for more than an hour should be covered."
,Allstone,1,This store does not cover their staff while on break. I have come twice now where the staff have been on break with no coverage  not convenient at all and not very customer focused.
,Andri Sadlak,2,"The official schedule says this post office is open on Sunday 10 am - 6 pm. I showed up with a huge and heavy package at 1:40 and nobody’s there with a sign “we’ll be back at 2” and “do not drop off any parcels or returns while we are closed”.

I wait until 2:05 for them to actually accept my package.

I only give them two stars for wasting so much customers’ time because they trued to notice when they’ll be back."
,Ben Cooner,5,A lot of Karens and Daves complaints. The individuals working and giving a service are just like you and me.. A Life. Use a courier if you  are so desperate.
,Trilby Wiens,5,I've always had friendly helpful service at this post office and not waited more than 5 minutes. I felt like hugging the staff after we moved here and I came for the first time... I was so used to being treated like a big inconvenience by staff at my last post office. Thank you!
,Jessi Pomeroy,2,"Normally great, closed over an hour early could not drop off my parcel. No notice or indication of adjusted hours."
,Cheryl McKelvey,5,"I visited this post office many times, and had a great experience each time.  There is a mature lady there at the counter who was so helpful when i put in my change of address, and also when i sent back my telus equipment.
Best service in town here, plus they really know Cda Post regs and policies.  Likely these people are all employees of Cda Post, not drug store employees who are responsible for learning everything in 1 week. I would not go anywhere else for anything semi-complex."
,Milajade Collections,5,"I guess there care about my business.  I've been using this post office for my companies documents and packages for years now.  My relationship with them is great, when I have a package that I missed waiting for me in my PO Box, they will send me a text or call me if it's at risk of being returned.  I would assume not many post offices would do that for their customers as many are almost hostile to their customers.  Glad I found this little gem of west van postal glory :)"
,Paul Silverstone,1,"I live in Park Royal Towers.   The mail delivery is the worst I have experienced.   Today is Monday the week after Labor Day weekend.   I subscribe to several magazines costing me  hundreds of dollars, some with time sensitive news.   I have  not received a single magazine in over 10 days.  Some are weekly mailed in Canada.   It is infuriating that I am not receiving my magazines in a timely fashion.    I would like to a better delivery system."
,Caity McDaniel,5,"This was some of the best customer service I have ever experienced. Every single person was accommodating, and they went completely out of their way to make sure I had a nice day. I would 100% recommend going to this post office! Although I was there for business, I may have to go there each time for my own mailing, even though I live in a different city! 5 stars."
,Aftaab Gulam,5,Fantastic service at the post office here. The staff are kind and courteous and always willing to go out of their way to accommodate all kinds of questions and requests.
,Yo Sep Lee,1,"I am hoping that I could give minus point
Even they were able to put my parcel on the mail box in the condo, arbitrarily dropped them at the post office for picking up so that I have to be experienced today's unpleasant event.
Mikami? Monami?
Before invoking regulation, don't you think you should stick to the rules?
Or you don't get to think before you spit it out."
,Jawad “Jawz” Ahmad,1,"No stationary, no assistance very surprising for a Postal company branch. No money orders available either. Guy wasn't helpful either on suggestions or pointers to another much more useful branch."
,Patrick Valdes,5,"It was half an hour before closing and it wasn't that busy today, though it was still steady. Whenever I have visited in the past, Joella, I think is what the Canada Post' rep's name was (on my receipt), she's always helpful with all customers!"
,Nicholas Au-Yeung,1,"AJAYPAL is super rude and unhelpful.

The lady infront of me was simply trying to mail a letter out but he made things super complicated for the lady. He ignores her question and replied with answers that were completely irrelevant.

She even ask the ""value"" of a written letter...."
,SAA G.,1,"One star seems too much!

December 1st 2021 around 11 am, I went there for a parcel pick up. Tried to explain to this clerk my situation and he got super passive aggressive, very rude, wouldn't even bother listening to me, wasted my time and gave me the wrong Poste Canada customer service phone line to call. Felt he like he didn't even want to work. Horrible experience!!"
,Guillaume Pelletier,1,"I’m so sorry to be rude, but the lady who works here doesn’t have two brain cells to rub together.

She complains that packages are too heavy, complains that there are too many packages, complains complains complains. Listen, dear lady… this is your job! Plenty of people would be happy to take your place.

She makes up weird rules about package measurements. She argues and berates even when you try and tell her you agree. She doesn’t make any sense. I don’t know what her problem is. Every single time I go there I have a hard time.

Go to any other Canada Post office and you will have a normal level of service."
,Kyal Scott,5,"Spoke on the phone with Christina about a missing item issue I had. She was lovely, warm and very specific with her help. Thanks again Christina!"
,Justin West,1,"Major snow storm this week, but I had to get a package out. After all, Christmas is on Sunday. Well, the folks at this location decided to close early (5pm) and just left a sign on the counter. They did peak their head out the window of the mail room and saw me, but quickly ducked so that they didn't actually have to come out and serve. Why? They are their, patrons who made it there had to brave the cold, slippery sidewalks, terrible driving conditions... why not just stay open, or at the very least, post something on line so people don't wait their time and safety."
,Jess Watson,1,"Horrible customer service, will actively avoid this location because of one specific employee that there’s countless reviews on here about."
,Mert Akbal,1,"I agree with everybody.  Same experience. They dismiss you although your parcel is right there in the back. I had to do a second trip there and it ruined my work day. I didn’t even mean to make the first trip, it was such an inconvenience.
1)You can just go back and check if you have a parcel for a name or address if delivery man forgot to drop the barcode. It has been done before in other Canada Post pick up locations. Why not? It is super easy.
2)The way you dismiss people and say “it is not me, I am not Canada post” is just unhinged. How would you feel if you went to some company’s supposed “location” and the people in uniform would say “I am not working for them”"
,Suleimy Rios Aguilar,3,"The location is great, close to the Metro station. I visit the location for the first time on Wednesday afternoon and the guy was rude, he saw me at the front desk but I took my time as I saw he was looking for a package after 5 minutes he decided to ask me ""what do you want?"" in a very rude way. I send letters often and this is the first time someone from the staff is rude or unfriendly, I request a stamp and he asked me ""cash or what?"", once I paid what the staff usually do is to give me the stamp and I place it but this time the guy place my stamp on the wrong position and almost in the middle of the envelope, I had to take it carefully to place it in the right place, trying not to break it. I know we all have bad days but unfortunately, I was not the only one as there were more people in line, dealing with his attitude."
,The Unboxer,1,"Bad service. They need to hire people who can speak proper English. The lady at counter refused to send my packaged wrist watch. After agreeing to accepting my package, all of a sudden she says her computer stopped working. That is ridiculous. Staff is untrained and doesn't speak proper English. Its sad to see you can't get professional. This is whats wrong with our unionized employees.."
,Ila Varshney,4,Very quick service. The lady on the store is very helpful. She not only suggested me best way to send my parcel but also helped me in regulating the maximum weight I can send in parcel. FYI- there are 2 ladies 1 is really helpful and other is super rude. You can easily notice the difference. Overall this location is far far better than Canada Post in Aberdeen center.
,Jana Evans,1,"Very bad service today. I usually find Indian lady here who is beyond helpful  but today there was short older lady, gray hair in longish bob who didn't even smiled. She was so overwhelmed by the work saying it is so busy and there were only few people in the line up which is normal for the postal office. I often send packages and the post office person always gives me an advice on what is the best and cheapest way. The Indian lady would always recommend how many packages to have and what weight not to reach etc. The same happens in Highgate mall Post Office where I go often as well. But today, the woman  just rejected all my questions repeating she is too busy (with 3 people waiting) . I decided not to send anything and just left.
If the job is too much for her and she cannot handle it, she shouldn't be doing it then. I know for the fact she is the exception as other people there are super helpful and fast at the same time.
UPDATE: Went to HighGate Mall Post Office in Burnaby last night. The person there helped me of course. First we tried to fit in the box but the weight was too much. Then he suggested the envelope, the same one I tried in Richmond but the cost here for the same service, same envelope  same weight and same destination  ended up costing 3 times less than what she told me. And all this while he had lineup twice as long as she did."
,Sul Haji,5,"Just went to post office at shoppers at 11am today, she was super busy and was handling still with excellent customer service. I needed to find a depot for our mail service and she found it for me!. Our own strata couldn't tell where it was but she found it for me. I am amazed at her customer service!"
,Bri,3,"Literally never open when they say they are. Have been short staffed for a year, so almost always close at 4pm. I recommend calling before..

Update - they’ve gotten much better! I still call before going though just to be safe."
,Sam Mansour,5,"Everybody here rocks!  Through all of the heavy seasons Canada Post, including this location, are a well-oiled machine!  The folks at this location are: Friendly, well-humored, welcoming, excellently trained and downright a part of the family.  The management should commend the people here.  Good stuff!!"
,Bren Da,5,"BIG thank you to the staff member that was working Dec 17 around 5-7pm. They helped me with a package that I needed URGENTLY. It had been delayed for a couple weeks, not delivered to my home and re routed to this office. I came in while they were quite busy near closing time but they still tended to me with the best customer service ever. LIFE SAVER!!!!!! You're the best."
,Brody Isaak,4,occasionally short staffed but always nice when you get to the front of the line
,Livia,1,"I’m at home, side by side with my phone on loud, and just got a notification that my parcel is here (again) to pick up because they could not “find me”. This time I essentially needed my package because has essential things on it. So tired of Canada Post laziness!"
,Wei Xu,1,"Arrived at 4:56pm on Saturday, and the lady refused to offer service. Even though I said I just needed a stamp. No wonder this center has such a bad review."
,Tim ಠ_ಠ “Psycho” Banana Cheese Cake,4,"Overall it's a fine experience, fast and simple process for picking up packages. Clerk could take more time with some customers (the ones that keep on talking about things other than the packages)... I don't blame the staff. 4 out of 5 due to the hours listed on Google vs the hours shown in the email.. can be confusing.."
,Mijoter Mijoter,1,"Today we wanted to send our money to Ukraine through MoneyGram, in our country is war...and this woman from Canada Post firstly asked about our address in Canada, but we're newcomers and have only temporary address in this mean secondly she rejected with MoneyGram transfer.
We just wants to cry
Wasting time and 0 result
She doesn't answer why she couldn't help with transfer money to Ukraine
Worse service and uncorrect behavior("
,Julian Zapanta,1,"I've been waiting in line and I was the 3rd person in the queue. It's been 20 mins all I wanted to do was drop off a package the Filipino girl working today at 9:30AM on Aug 21, 2017 should learn how to prioritize. If she dealt with the things that would take longer after there were 5 people waiting in line things would be much simpler for her and everybody else. Thank god she doesn't work in a hospital as a nurse because I guarantee due to lack of prioritizing her patients would die and she'd be the cause of it."
,XY XY,1,This is arguably the worst Canada post office in the city and the worst i have ever experienced in my life. The clerk was late 10 min today with opening and she is so slow that it takes forever to finish with one single customer. Federal Canada post should shut down this post or change the owner of the licence as soon as possible !
,Michael Bergman,1,Would prefer they honor the hours they post publicly to Google Maps instead of hanging signs on the counter stating that they're on break. They're unreliable and it's inconsiderate.
,puoɯʎɐᴚ,5,"I only have good experiences here. If wait times are long, how is that the employee's fault?"
,Анастасия Корр,5,"Very nice lady works there, helped me quickly to figure out what to do and get my parcel."
,Jacques Wang,1,"Canada Post understaffed even in peak office hrs, service is way too slow. Expect to wait 20+ min if you go during peak times"
,wild cloud,5,Kind staff ♥️
,Nika Niknam,5,"In this office, a young kind gentleman named “Aboud” works. He has a great sense of customer service. He always provide you with useful information. He explains everything with patience. I couldn't have posted some of my documents without his help and he makes me feel at ease. I believe he deserves a raise."
,Rosie Keli,1,"Terrible and disrespectful employee.The lady was extremely rude and not helpful. It’s one thing to not be able to help out a costumer but it’s another to not even try and disregard them completely. I told the lady how I was never asked if I wanted tracking number or not. She did not believe me. It is my 10th time properly sending package through this exact post office and I always asked for tracking number. I send important documents why would I not ask for a tracking number. I understand they might have made a mistake or maybe even I did but for her to be this level of disrespectful and straight up mean and rude. Yeah no, if you don’t want to get your package lost and have employees disrespect you don’t come here. Terrible service. Human to human you got to treat people with respect. Never coming here again."
,Xiaodan Zhang,1,"A counter named Jenny was very rude and irresponsible. She was not able to give appropriate instructions to customers who mail their passports to the visa center for the first time, even though I double-checked with her beforehand. Once she found something was not right afterwards,  she just said it was the customer's thing, anyway, it had nothing to do with her, the customer should have asked her, otherwise she won't give any instructions in detail. I don't think she cannot understand how important the passport is to everyone, but she doesn't care about any customer, and just shirks responsibility and blames others."
,Manik Mahajan,5,The staff is very helpful. I would recommend if you are sending out your documents because the staff is already aware about the different envelopes to use and how to send out these documents.
,Karim Beydoun,4,Only 1 employee is there.. The line is big specially during peak hour. Should consider adding more employees to speed up the service. Otherwise it's a good post service as expected.
,Lakhvirkaur,1,"ridiculous experience of receiving the item. it’s been 19 days i haven’t received my item and when i call to the customer service they said sender has to claim. but i don’t need the money i need my item. so bad delivery service of canada post. my item should be returned back to the sender address after 10 days at least but nothing is done like that. i am so unsatisfied with the service. 😣😣😣😣😣

i will never choose canada post ever to send my items. never ever

update on my lost bag - 4/4/2023
Never received… lost forever"
,Tirupathi Rao Papeneni,5,This is a good for business spot and it was kind of slow because they have only employee and and she is mid 40+ but she is working good
,Mai Omran,4,"A bit of a slow line process, employees were friendly, helpful, and efficient"
,Hiten Patel,1,"Extremely worst Canadian post service till date in my life , guy with the glasses just ignored my queries and behaved like get out of my store. Unexpected behavior . However same question was solved politely  by staff OF  JEAN - COUTE (Canadian post)"
,Marie O,1,"PR CARD STOLEN HERE

PLEASE HELP!

I left the card on the counter after using it as piece of ID. I came back the next day and it was nowhere to be found.

The people working here say they didn't see it so someone must have found it and taken it with them.

I have an emergency trip to go see a relative who is dying and I need my card to return to Canada. I will be stranded and unable to re-enter for weeks without it. If you found it PLEASE GIVE IT BACK."
,G N,1,I had the worst customer service experience ever. The employee who assisted me was of a certain age and incredibly rude. I was shocked when she started raising her voice at me this Friday afternoon. Her behavior was completely unprofessional and unacceptable
,Stephanie Rao,1,"I came at 12pm at the officially open time and the lady was just arrived so it took time to open the cashier. Okay I understand! But I can’t wait I leave. Then I came again afternoon 4:45pm, then they don’t let me in! Cuz they have to close the cashier sharp at 5pm! And there is too much people in front That’s ridiculous!!"
,M A,1,"Very bad service.
Don't even go there if u want to recive or send money via moneygram. First they are rude and not respectful.
Second they always don't have cash to give you your transaction."
,Harshil Soni,1,"The branch isn’t keeping up with the customers, there are 3 desk and hardly one person working in there, we are 15 lined up for the service 🫡"
,M V,4,"July 13th at around 4PM employee name is Latifa
I go to this Canada post quite often, the entire staff is extremely friendly except for one lady. I have the feeling the rest of the staff there is compensating for her rudeness. She is so clearly not made for customer service and it never fails. I am writing this review because today was just that one extra sass I didn’t feel like dealing with in all honesty. Her attitude is incomprehensible, she will find any reason to start an argument or start a fight I feel. I have witnessed this with other customers as well so it can’t be a personal reason towards me. All in all this Canada post has the most helpful and friendly staff except for that elderly lady. And total side note, she will switch from English to French even though I am speaking English to her; she starts off with English but when she wants to get sassy she switches to French. I really wish she would get a different job where she has no contact with people, like stocking shelves or something."
,Nabeel Ali,1,Unreal that this place is allowed to function the way it is. 4 people behind the counter yet only 2 are serving customers while there’s a line of 15-20 people. 30 minutes wait time just to pick up a package? Absolutely unreal…..
,Richard Boivin,1,Old man who served me was extremely slow and rude during the whole process. Save yourself the headache and go somewhere else.
,strat19931,1,The lines are at least 20- 30 minutes due to slow semicompetant service. One person at the counter does not work...need 2 people at all times minimum. Customers should also try not to be idiots to speed thing along
,M F,5,Sharuyan was amazing. So patient and helped me with many packages. Great employee.
,Lea Tewfik,1,"Waited 45 minutes in line to make a few returns and got ""served"" by the rudest person I have ever seen."
,Rami brm,1,The customer service at this post is terrible. Adam was the agent in charge he was not respectful at all and shoot for no reason. I gave him a good lesson of respect and complaint on him online. Hope you guys at canada post improve your service. Adam should be returned home to learn how to communicate respectfully in the society before going to work. Adam should be fired.
,Megan Yang,1,"The staff kept rolling her eyeball and frowned at everybody for no reason.  She yelled to the poor guy to do things as what she asked. Then turned to me, give me your address. Then I asked don’t you have to measure my package before you type them in? She went what’s your problem!? I was like ****!?? As she was ignoring my asking, one of her colleagues came. And made a suggestion telling me it would be cheaper if I choose to use their prepaid box. Before I got the chance to respond, the lady yelled at him let me finish my work, don’t interrupt me. Then I brought my question out again. To everyone‘s surprise, she just left leaving me full of questions in my head!!! Don’t know what annoyed her.  While filling the address, I heard she yelled like you’re not the boss!Don’t talk to me! Apparently this is to her colleague who tried to start a conversation with her. The attitude is fantastic!"
,luojihencha WhyYouCare,1,"I should have writen a bad review last time. Because of high gas price I went this Canada post again. The staff keeps rolling her eyeball when you ask her simple question like what is the price for register mail.  And I only asked once. Don’t know why that annoyed her. The attitude is fantastic, fantastic eyeballs rolled"
,B.E.L,2,"I was waiting in the line patiently and was listening the guy (employee)repeating the same things second time to the customer front of me. The customer looked confused and sad because she came all the way to post her package and the guy was keep repeating her that he cannot take the package because she has to press the paper stronger so the letters on the copy would be visible. The customer was sad and “oh really”… He could simply tell her to re-write the paper on the table on the side, close to the counter. I involved and tried to explain her that she doesn’t have to go back home, she could write there.  The guy was disturbed and almost chewed me out, said “ madam take your time but wait for your turn please “ ! What an unkind dushbag! Instead of repeating same useless explanation, do something problem solving, I thought myself… However I could only said “I was trying to help sir”… Btw, there were 2-3 more customers waiting in line behind me. Slow and unkind service!"
,Loïc Yavercovski,5,"Went there for the first time since since the Canada post at Monk is closed… I went to send an international package and the Asian lady there helped me. I think it’s the first time I deal with à Canada post employee that is so nice, polite and willing to help that I decided to write a review."
,Hien and Huy Vu,1,"Bad service. A staff who worked on Friday ( July 21, 2023) is very rude, not friendly..."
,Jessica Wu,5,"I appreaciate the fact this post office have longer hours then other post offices. Once my package got sent to this location for pickup, I was super happy because it fit my busy daytime schedule.

The staffs are very helpful and they deserve my respect for their hardwork. Two weeks ago, I tried to go there find some limited edition stamps, although they have runned out of the stamps I was looking for, the staff tried to assist me as much she could. 😘"
,Jo M,5,"Really great service unlike a lot of other Canada Post counters in Montreal. Very fast and efficient lady who is extremely service minded. I have been there 3 times and was lucky to be attended to by the same spectacled, thin, short lady who is really nice. Don't know her name, but she is like a machine. Amazing!"
,Mouris Khouri,4,A very good Canada post branch. Place is clean and very well organized.  Employees are nice and you can see right away that they do their best in order to serve their clients better. Services fees are the same of course like any other branch but at least they offer a fast and reliable service. It's really a professional teams and good management
,CaCaDamz,1,"I can understand this place gets very busy with line ups... However, if I call and you answer, I'm no less a customer and do not need to be talked to in a rushed or rude manner. I might not be on the other side of the counter, but that doesn't mean you can't be helpful and rule out manners. The woman I spoke to flat out hung up on me. Wow! Grade A service..."
,Lauren Lin,5,"Fast service!
Droped by to return my WIFI modem today. I read the reviews and pretty worried it'll take too long, but its done in 5 minutes! There is a white young guy, sry i dont know his name, who is friendly and efficient!👍"
,fahime heydari,1,"Worst staff ever. I had to leave home 15 mind early to get my parcel sent before work but the guy in the counter was soooooo slow motion that I ended up leaving without getting my packages sent. Extremely incompetent staff. I guess they take a ""who hates working"" test before hiring these people. Incompetent incompetent incompetent"
,13APHOMET CHANNELLING,5,"MY NAME IS MICHAEL, I HAVE BEEN A CLIENT AT THIS L0CATI0N F0R YRS INCLUDING 0THER L0CATI0NS,
NIC0LETTE THE MANAGER IS ABS0LUTELY GREAT AS WELL AS HER STAFF!"
,Emilia Lu,1,"Unbelievable attitude, everything worked out smoothly last time when I was picking up the package but this time the old lady refused to give me my package although I have my physical passport. Wonder if it’s due to any discrimination issue. Terrible service, I would rather return my package!

Went in again and asked for her name: Nikolai. Unlike her, the guy with glasses was very friendly."
,Guo Tang,1,"I paid over 130 dollars to sent a package and received discrimination from the staff! I wonder if my money will be used to pay those people for their food??? It’s not a good way to waste food though! This feeling is even worse than paying taxes!
Canada Post, Canada Worst!"
,Jette Roma,1,"Update your hours! Such an incovenience. Google says you close at 9, you should abide by it! Arrived before 8 and it is already locked. Such a waste of time coming here."
,Marc Zehil,1,"Google says it closes at 9, I arrive at 7h50 and they say they're closed at 8h. Employes clearly don't want to work and try to get out early. Disgusting."
,Mando Rico,5,"I always get friendly and efficient service with Lisa. Wait times are usually tied to the volume of foreign money transfers made, and not postal operations. Avoid pay day and benefits evenings if at all possible."
,DEEPAK SHARMA,2,Too slow. Time consuming though successful results.
,Vincent Belhumeur,1,Adjust the hours on google maps as the store closes before 21h as indicated online...
,Yixuan Li,1,"Zero star. This was the first time I came to this Canada Post location. The experience was awful! The front desk lady was soooo rude and threw my return packages on the floor, when she saw the customer she didn’t even say hi or a word! She seemed very angry about nothing. I didn’t remember her name, there were two staffs there, and the one treated me badly was an older Indian women. Canada post, please do something about this staff! Customers need to be treated nicely! Never come to this location again! Such a Shame!"
,Irena Ladna,1,Zero star!!! Worst service ever. Not friendly and rude woman. Agresive to customers.
,Hatem Megaly,1,"Below zero, the woman on the counter her name is Derola, aggressive, rude, impolite, arrogant.
Reported her to Canada Post and I WILL NOT LET IT GO.
How come with all the negative reviews here, they still keep her there.
Again, I WILL NOT LET HER GO WITH THE WAY SHE TREATED ME.
The worst place ever."
,bruh bruv,5,"I don't understand the negative reviews. Post Canada, a crown corporation, has a habit of making things complicated and the employees are aware of that. It's not worth getting frustrated at them.

However, if you would just listen properly, they can give you all the information you need and the process is super smooth and honestly quite pleasant.

The woman at the counter is the GOAT"
,siva ramakrishna,1,"This by far is the WORST Canada Post location I have ever come across. The staff have been rude and unprofessional. And it happened several times with different employees. So it definitely wasn't an issue with a particular individual. Their service is bad. I went to pick up something and the lady just said, computer isn't working and you can comeback in an hour. And when u called her after 2 minutes she said everything is working well.
I wish They weren't lazy and have empathy for customers"
,bayboy kg,1,Disgusting service by Alexandra the manager very arrogant. This canada post already has 2.8 stars .hope higher staff will notice and make some improvements.
,Sally M,3,"3/5 times there's an issue with my pickups... A couple of times the manager claimed I picked up my package, but thankfully the staff remembered me and told her I hadn't picked up that specific shipment. Another time they lost boxes and the manager was supposed to call me back - 2 weeks on and a couple of calls in between - I returned to be told they still hadn't found the boxes. I eventually got them, no comment... I have so many more examples of poor service unfortunately. This place can definitely be managed better! However, overall, the staff I land on have been nice and do their best with situations handed from what I've seen."
,Panteha Mamouri,1,"Generally, I am not a fan of this branch. The staff are VERY slow and undertrained. And it’s always a nightmare wanting to get your package from them. I was picking up a package one time and the lady couldn’t find it. She asked for my number to call me back whenever it was found, but never did. I had to go back a few days later and she said she forgot to look for it, but this time she just found the package in the back.

Though, one time we arrived 15 minutes before they close, and we had 5 boxes being shipped internationally. They stayed 20 minutes late just for us and processed all our packages for shipping. We are very thankful for that."
,SD,5,Patrick was the only one serving and he did hell of a job considering a massive line-up! Canada Post needs to deploy more workforce! One person working in the whole branch is not normal!
,Hossein,4,"Speaking of the staff at Canada Post, they are quick-handed and gracious when responding to customers. In addition, they do care about your delivery problems. A case in point is the time when it took just a bit long for my package to arrive for which one of the clerks working there described the procedure. He also provided me with a number to follow up on my postages.

The downside, however, is that there seems not to be two staff working there simultaneously all the time which makes  customer service a bit intolerable not only for the lonely clerk but also for customers to wait up in line.

All in all, I'm quite satisfied with the customer service provided at Canada post. I believe authorities could provide customers with seats to sit while waiting in line especially for the elderly people who are unable to be standing for even 10 straight minutes."
,Jacques Wang,1,"Very slow service, poor customer service
Employee was not available between 13:50 and 14:15 (I guess for lunch or smoke break?)
The staff being not present eems to be a recurrent problem"
,Alexandra Rupp,3,"The staff are good and friendly, but they seem very understaffed and the wait is often very long, especially if all you want to do it drop off a parcel that has a prepaid shipping label."
,sandip gadhiya,1,The employees don't know how to verify documents. They don't know what sorts of documents they have to check even if it's written on the documents.
,Jane FP,5,"Excellent service. Kind staff. I went on Tuesday night when it was very busy; yet, the service was still friendly and courteous."
,D C,2,There staff is often absent. Long lines.
,Lucas H,1,"I walk in to return a package and am told that they have no tape. Okay, I go to dollarama to buy my own roll. Come back after to get my label printed via email. Apparently they don’t print labels and tape boxes anymore. Was told to go to bureau en gros to print it. Nice!"
,Arlina Hysi,1,"Very bad experience with the employee working there. Constantly made fun of me and offended me for not knowing how mailing works. After I left and did not even say a word to her , I heard her talking to one of her colleagues about me while they were both laughing. The worst experience I have ever had. The employees name is Whitney"
,Sunidhi Sunidhi,1,I went to jean coutu to print the document and I don’t know if there was a problem in the  machine or in my usb and the lady at the cashier sent someone to help me and the guy came and said I don’t even know how it works. Like wow👏👏👏 great costumer service. Your employees don’t even know how the things work. Thanks for wasting my time.
,Handeep kaur,5,The staff boy zakkery is very kind and helpful . Awsm service 👍👍👍
,Lisa Caplan,5,"Incredible service! I'm disabled and my medication comes by mail once or twice a week The folks at Roxboro go SO far out of their way to help me - they have located missing parcels, expedited deliveries, they have resent packages twice in one day - and they are just so kind and understanding. It's not often that anything that is a part of a governmental bureaucracy works at all, much less well enough to cater to a single individual's needs,, but thee guys get it spot on - I often feel I've traveled back to a nicer era when dealing with them - THANK YOU!!!"
,Emma najjar,1,"That's awful. Especially the two Chinese employees that they are. I want to freely write that the manager should train them again!
He gave me the cardboard glue and told me to glue the cartons yourself because it is yours and this was the first experience in my life that the post office employee is so rude and irresponsible!
Or the Chinese girl employee is very impatient and irresponsible. Because I live in this neighbourhood, I have to go and every time I see these two people, I return home disappointed and angry."
,D. W.,2,"Thought I got charged twice for one shipping envelope, asked the worker if they made a mistake. They denied it, and once I paid and got my receipt, I could confirm I was charged twice. Inattentive and sloppy. Expensive to mail a small package as always, inside Canada or to the US. Will try the UPS shipping on Notre Dame next time."
,Ekaterina E,1,12 o’clock on Sunday it is closed. On Google maps your working hours on Sunday are 09:00-17:00. I made my way from Île des sœurs to see that you are closed?!
,Jeannie Lee,2,"The red hair lady at the desk will find a reason not to send your package and when she does, she’ll give you a big smirk. The rest of the staff are great."
,Semeon Arthamonov,4,"Ever since the working hours were reduced, you have to wait in a noticable line. Otherwise, great place with a very friendly staff."
,Adam Dadoun,2,Staff is super friendly. A gentleman helped me with the self serve machine... there was one big package that could not fit in so I waited in line. 2 persons in front left and lost patience. The lady at the cash is very slow and i think the man that helped me was on break but still... you are expected to postpone your break when it gets packed..  everyone is frustrated in the line. More staff should work there on weekends since this is when people are not working or in school and actually go to the post office .. 😒
,Raiden Yvelina,5,"Never waited more than 5 minutes and staff is very competent! If you are in a rush perhaps don’t go during rush hour, or have your parcels delivered to a less central location 🙂"
,Alexander Peplowski,4,"There's usually a line around rush hour, but aside from that I've never had a problem picking up a package here"
,Amy Tang,1,"Service so slow that makes me never want to go get my package. Very disorganized and really horrible service. They close at 5 but in reality closes at 4:45 because of their lazy, slow and inefficient staff. Worst post Can I’ve ever been to."
,Lucas Lacerda,5,"Staff was very helpful every time I needed to go there. Fast, friendly and efficient service :)"
,Donka,2,"Empty counter with two person behind it  :)  Very rude young lady, forcing herself to be polite ! She wasn't very helpful. So I went on the other side of Decarie, way better but of course crowed as usual."
,Brandon Berkovits,4,"FYI for everyone.  canada post website says typical operation times but there is a note at the counter saying otherwise.

,Luis Rodriguez,5,The service is perfect.
,Chito Aipheng,1,Worst service. The attendant was incredibly arrogant.
,Jacklyn Leonard-Bourdages,1,"The lady working last night has 0 customer service skills. Saying “Yup” to call the next customer, belittling customers because they were having trouble understanding her, throwing a box into the back storage area, slamming things on counter. I’m pretty sure my shipping was already included with my return but I paid anyways because I didn’t want her to make me feel stupid. I understand that we need to be patient since finding and hiring staff is difficult these days, however, this was unacceptable."
,Flavio Das Chagas Dias,5,Very friendly and professional staff.
,Kiri Siva,5,I don't understand why people are giving it a 1 star rating. It's a post office for God's sake. The staff is always helpful especially the young lady with piercings.
,Terina M,5,"Been going here quite often, and as always, great service, friendly and knowledgable staff, always a pleasure doing business with them."
,Mostafa Eletriby,5,Excellent sevice
,Alain Chelala,1,"Same issue as most people here, the falsely advertised business hours.
But in my case the ones I read weren't even on google, I received a notice by mail to go pick up an item at this Canada Post and the business hours in the letter itself were wrong! Thinking the store closed at 9pm I also went right before 7 just to find out that they were going to close. I tried speaking to the employee to explain that their own notice said they d be open and see if she could just pass me my package, but she wouldn't hear it and was extremely rude."
,aly muh,1,"I used to work at the post office and I simply asked for 1 white blank paper that I can use as a cheat sheet for an exam the next day at cegep. The guy refused to give me one even tho I used to give ppl ONE BLANK piece of paper if ppl asked. This was during the pandemic so libraries and university buildings were closed and buying a whole pack of blank papers was just expensive. Travelled 1 hour back home just to get a paper then back to coffee shop to study 🙄 Was also willing to pay for a blank piece of paper or even print something but he said it wasnt allowed ?? 🤣🤣 Yep, this scene still comes back to me to this day."
,Michael Valela,1,What a disgrace for a business. I used the search tool on Canada post to find a store and it gave me this one with specific hours saying it’s open at 9pm. I show up and they put a sign saying it closes a 7pm. I come to google and it also says it’s open until 9pm then I look at all the reviewers on this business complaining for the same thing and it has been years. It’s 2023 fix your hours. What a joke.
,Joe Will,1,"Dont go there. Fake business hours. The doorman says they close at 6 pm, when Google says 9 pm. I said hey, you made me drive from far for that? She says ah, well, everyone else has complained but no one does anything. The lazy ones. 😴"
,Alex Charlebois,1,"By far the worst post canada.
You will wait forever for anything.
No staff. Suuuuper slow service every time i have been here. Avoid. Post Canada on Park avenue is much faster service"
,SERGUEI DRATCHEV (Heavy Haul TV),5,"I'm not sure what most people are complaining about. Canada Post as a whole is one thing; customer service / people working at this branch is another. I find that people behind the counter are more often than not pleasant, friendly and efficient. The line-up - if there's one - keeps moving, because there's usually there's two cash registers open. The only thing I don't like is that I have to drive 8 km from Skyview Ranch thru convoluted residential streets. I usually get lost on the way here. I wish they'd open a Canada Post in my area -- T3N 0V2."
,Mariam Tauseef,1,"They have pathetic service. Irresponsible ppl working for delivery.  They put my parcel in someone else's mailbox and I had a pkg in my mailbox for my neigbors. And on top, just offered me compensation for $20 for a $90 worth of pkg."
,G D,1,"Wait times are over 40 mins, 1 person working 20 people waiting. I don’t know why Canada post has secure mailboxes in residential areas and you still have to come to pick up. No consistency there is a location 1km from my residence yet I have to go 10km die some reason. They do western union some other money sending avenues, so next level services all that’s missing is a Tim Hortons in here now for 1 employee to do that as well and people can stay there all day long."
,Eze,1,"No good customer service there, you wait for the staff and none of them seems to bother to help or redirect you.  The door to Canada post is always closed and you end up standing and waiting for them to help you but they are less bothered but helping their nationality. Today’s evening experience was not good January 10th, 2023. The lady walked past me seeing I had a parcel in my hand alongside a 3yrs old but she stayed inside without coming out until a fellow nationality of hers came before the door was opened. It’s better that place is equipped with people who are good with customer service and also their job, this is not the first time it’s happening. I have never written a review but I can’t let this slide. I hope this is looked into. Never recommend"
,Jasmeen Kaur,1,"I just went there waited 15 minutes in a line and the person working there named jeremie just don’t know anything about canada post services, I asked him do they have any mail box available and he said I don’t about that I don’t know where are the keys and stuff and come back in weekdays, if he just don’t know anything why he’s standing right there to serve customers just wasted my time"
,Bertine Faria,3,"First time ever sending a parcel.  I have learned i am scared less of rock climbing then dealing with post office people.  The term “going postal” didn't spawn from thin air after all.  That being said, it was a smooth process but it was a feeling of if i blinked wrong I would be grounded for a week with no tv and video games.  Not an atmosphere some of my more spiritual acquaintances could have probably managed.  Alas I endured and made it out alive."
,Manoj,5,Very impressed with the quick service. I wanted to send a parcel to the UK and the staff Vidya who attended me was pleasant and briefed me on the available options. She  listened to my questions patiently and helped me to choose the best option. I would rather prefer to drive down and visit this PO than my nearest PO where the staff needs proper training on customer interaction.
,Curtis Knows,5,"This is the best Canada post office I have been to. The staff here help you with minor requests that you would normally expect.

Unlike the one at Shawnessy where they rtry to make you buy tape if you need only a little.

Pleasant staff there even though it's a different person everytime.

Sufficient parking space to accommodate a large number of motorist customers."
,Weedasec Genetics,1,Stopped using this location and use one at rexal . Staff is always rude at shoppers location in Mckenzie
,Peace of Nature,1,The blonde lady with glasses Im guessing her name is Angela  is the worst person to deal with . I said hi to her  when I first approached her and her response was HHMMMHH .  Through our whole transaction she was being super rude. DO NOT GO HERE ! You will have a bad day.
,Philippe-Rene Armand,1,"So incredibly frustrating dealing with them. So many departments not speaking to one an other. Purchased address redirect. But of course this doesn't apply to packages (found out after the fact). If I specifically purchase the address redirect why are they delivering to an old address (I know not their problem). Why didn't you call me, or email, or try to reach me... So super duper sorry. We don't call. Why not leave it a the hub...So super duper sorry. We don't do that either. What a terribly run business."
,Muskan Pugalia,1,The lady helping us at Canada post seem like she didn’t want to be there. Unfriendly and inconsiderate to begin with. Totally ruined our experience. I think her name was Griva. She was hard to approach but later due to obligation to be helpful;  helped us to figure something out on our document once we called out her rigidness.
,Ryan Sloan,5,"I use Canada Post at this location regularly for mailing products for my business. The employees are very friendly and helpful. Katherine especially is one of my favourite employees as she has a thorough knowledge of different shipping methods and always recommends ways to save on shipping.  I usually mail 20 or more packages at a time and the staff are always very efficient in preparing my order. Some of the other reviews on here are negative due to 2 main categories: 1) having to wait in line, 2) employees following Canada post protocol. I believe these negative reviews should be disregarded because they are unreasonable. Some people’s shipping order may take longer for the employees to process than others. To wait in line while others are served should not be an unreasonable expectation. In my hundreds of times shipping here I have never had to wait in line for an unreasonable amount of time and I recommend some of the other rude people reviewing on here to learn some respect for others. In my experienced perspective of shipping here on a regular basis, the service is excellent, delivery is reliable, price is affordable, employees are knowledgeable, kind and friendly. 5 stars, highly recommend."
,Megan L,1,"Unreliable deliveries. My temperature sensitive package sat in a truck for 3 days, while ""out for delivery"". My business, customers and product suffered. They offer no assistance or have any clue what's happening with anything that isn't directly related to the cash register."
,visitor 70027,1,"I had a lady who refused to help me because it was 8:01 pm and her argument was that she doesn't have the technology to do her work one minute after 8 pm. I had run around right after work to have the document printed and sent by Canada post, I couldn't get it sent due to her unwillingness to help me out at 8:01 which she expressed in a very rude and condescending manner. Terrible customer service and pathetic behaviour to get rid of customers this way in order not to spare two minutes."
,R Man Rentals,1,I typed in Canada post drop off location on Google. This is the place he brought me to I was nearby. They brought me to the back parking lot super hard. I have wasted about 10 minutes trying to find somewhere to park and then I had to walk about five minutes to get to the front office just to find out that they were unhelpful and not gonna take my packages. This was on July 21 at 7:04pm
,Rissa,1,"Remember when Canada Post was reliable? They've lost my package and opening tickets for them to investigate always just leaves you with nothing

I have another ticket from last year that I never got an update on. I love losing my money because they can't deliver packages!!!! So great!!!"
,Konnor Drw,1,My package was delivered yesterday and the delivery driver forgot to leave me a key so I can get it I have called and gotten a service ticket for an investigation and they said it would take up to 3 day to complete not I’m not impressed about the service
,Jayrodacus,3,"Anytime u order a package and it has to come through the Calgary sorting facility there is a delay. Either the item is sent to the wrong place or it isn't scanned and I have no idea where it is going or how long it will take. Then Canada Post just comes up with a lame brain excuse that is either borderline a lie or just straight up a complete lie. Might as well kick us in the Johnson and act like nothing happened. Extend your delivery standard because it's never on time and support is a joke. I feel bad for the workers at the post office because a lot of the time they get heat most the time. Canada Posts insecure system inaccurate and false delivery times are what make it so bad, but I wouldn't doubt if it was being taken advantage of. Security must be a joke to these guys."
,Kevin Oneil,1,My question is how do you charge for xpress day guaranteed delivery 1-3 business days and hold it at the sorting facility all day July 14 and now claim maybe Monday um no that’s called false advertising how have you not been sued yet! For real let’s all do class action 250 million dollar lawsuit and shut them down for good! Also why when you ship from Grand Prairie do you take it to sorting there then to Edmonton sorting drive right by olds to Calgary sort there to come all the way back this way no wonder you loose mail for real you don’t need to send to 3 sorting facilities unreal
,Lorenzo Lopez,1,Hands down the worst customer service experience I've ever had with Sameer. He was rude & just kept looking at his phone and laughing while I was trying to pick up my parcel. I reacted & had to go to the Canada Post delivery depot just to pick up mail and some were sent to this location only for them to send it back to the sender without my permission. Hundreds of dollars down the drain. 🙄
,mathew chin,5,Went in to get postage and weigh my letters for Christmas the service was fast and pleasant with both azad and shirzad I hope I have the names right were very pleasent and helpfully couldn't ask for more
,Jo Queen,1,"Do not go here. I came to pick up a package and this man, named Sameer said my name wasn't in the system and I have no package. 5 minutes later he found it. And I asked why it wasn't there before? He started arguing and yelling over me that I couldn't even hear myself. Gross customer service. It must be a Canada post thing? I've had the exact same experience at 2 other Canada posts. The training really must be something... lol"
,charlene lohnes,5,"I was just reading a news story on my phone, I was very disappointed on hearing that Canada Post was not working hard enough to get parcels out. Well I will say they are the BEST I have never had a bad incident with them. I got a call last night from a friend to tell me my parcel will not be to me till January 4th. Well surprise there really is a pandemic out there and these postal workers put their life on the line for all of us. Maybe next time you are not happy I suggest you apply for a job. Merry Christmas to all GREAT PEOPLE, THANK_YOU CANADA POST"
,Hung Woo,5,"May 31, 2020.  I went to send a package to USA.  I am very lucky, having  Jana to help me.  Jana is really nice and helpful, helping me to prepare the package.  She was very nice, efficient and helpful to the two customers in front of me and myself.  I wish Canada post has more of staffs like Jana.
Thank you again."
,Gurumoorthy Mohan,5,"Had a great experience here today, i got prompt response from Amit, he was knowledgeable and suggested me the options for the post I am sending. There is also unique coins and postage envelopes available in all sizes, you just need to go there with your things to post, find an envelope or cardboard to fit it and pay all together when posting, its seamless."
,Ali,1,"They make way too many mistakes here. Drive a little further if you must to avoid using the services here. They will almost guaranteed lose your order.

- So far they’ve lost an iPhone that I sent to the states.
- They have “sent back” a suit which I was refunded for, while they still had the suit sitting in their back shelves.
- They have given me a receipt for a clothing order which was supposedly sent back, but never received by the clothing shop."
,Madison Hamilton,1,"Wish I could give 0 stars. The old short haired blonde lady treated my boyfriend and I with us with sheer disrespect. I wish I got her name — I still may look into this further. She wouldn’t do an identity confirmation because we are from Ontario even though we had a photo health card, birth certificate and credit bureau bill with an address matching what was on file. I’m so disappointed with the manner in which we were treated. She told us to try another canada post? If another canada post can do it then why couldn’t she? Grouchy and rude, definitely shouldn’t be employed here with an attitude like that."
,Alyssa P,5,"Here again today on Dec.7th 2020. The line is even crazier with 4 people behind me but we are moving.

Update:

Mid Covid19: Lines are insane but it is December now and we are trying to space out 6 ft. Try to come at non rush times for timely service or if you have issues with standing long wait times (such as myself). Thankfully they moved the line down to another aisle so we are no longer by the pharmacy.

Pre Covid19: Good service in a timely manner this past holiday season rush."
,Aditya Moosad,1,Canada Post is the first postal service that asks people to bring their own customs form. If that is indeed the process then they should print that in big bold letters! Not make the person wait in line and tell them when they get to the counter. Absolutely terrible service! I never had such issues in the States.
,Sierra Alexis,2,"Getting very tired of people not wanting to do their jobs.

I’ve been to this location on multiple occasions for work, and I was quickly reminded why I choose to go to the location by my house across the city.

There are 3 employees that I regularly deal with Katherine and Inge (two older women), and a younger girl who is relatively new (Nancy). The two older women are past retiring age and make it very clear in their customer service that they are resentful of that fact. Nancy is wonderful and from what I’ve seen is completely capable of doing her job, but the older women treat her as if she’s incompetent to overcompensate for their laziness.

On this particular day, I approached Inge at the register when it was my turn in line, and she made it clear that she was unhappy with the volume of items I had. She informed me that when there is a line, they cannot be doing separate transactions (mind you, I was the only one in line at this point). I told her that I am happy to get back in line should people come, but I need to do separate transactions. Apparently that answer didn’t satisfy her displeasure for me simply being a customer at her job, because she continues to tell me that they can’t do it and there must be a way around it. I tell her that there is no way around it, and that I have been doing this for years. She tells me that they only allow separate transactions for law offices, and some other kind of business. I tell her that I am indeed a law office, which is why there is no way around it. She tells me once again that there must be. I tell her that it is a Court requirement and she passes me off to another employee (Nancy) and is sure to tell her just how much stuff I have and how inconvenient it is. Nancy proceeds to scan my items without issues, while Inge continues to complain to the other employee (Katherine) about the volume of items that I have.

I work for a small law office, which means that I regularly need to mail out multiple legal documents at a time, but on separate transactions. Every time I approach the counter, I apologize for the volume of items that I have, and make it clear that I am happy to stand in line as many times as it takes to get through my items. Is this something that I need to do? No. But I am a considerate person, which makes things extra frustrating when I’m made to feel like the scum of the earth for simply asking that the employees do their jobs."
,FrostByte,1,"If I can rate a negative star I would. The lady behind the counter has absolutely no customer service skills and has very little knowledge about the canada post app. I was trying to mail out a parcel to the states, I even completed the customs form in the mobile app to save time. She kept insisting that I needed to fill out 2 other forms for the customs (kinda beats the purpose of the customs app). I mentioned to her that the downtown canada post location didn’t ask me to fill out any forms once I’ve completed the form through the app all they did was scan the code and the process was done very quickly. She still won’t accept it and she has no idea how that process works. I got fed up and left. I went to the southcentre location and they were able to complete my request in two minutes without filling out a physical form! Canada Post Woodbine location highly not recommended if you don’t want your time wasted."
,NejiRaven,1,"The women behind the counter are really rude each time I come here, it's actually shocking how unpleasant two people can be on a regular basis. One time I placed my return package on the counter and before I could say anything, the woman looks at me just goes ""what? what do you want?"" .... well I want a new car but given that I'm at a post office I probably want you to scan my package idk"
,Eugene Fernandes,4,"I've always been treated professionally here. To the lady who was referred to Evergreen's post office, it's because only some offices are authorized to process student loans. Blaming the post office for something they don't control is unfair."
,M VW,5,"I have been there many times with either international parcels or mail box problems  and I have had nothing but top notch service and the people even act like they really care. Nothing but positives for this location. Go in with a smile, come out with a smile."
,Rohit Chhibber,1,"Never go for Canada Post, they never even attempt to deliver your parcel and they have a funny policy regarding this. Your complaints won't work as well.
The policy states that you will need to pick up the parcel yourself from the nearest shoppers location if the size of the package doesn't fit the community box.
They will not attempt even few steps to deliver the parcel.."
,Ching Rubachuk,1,"Holly is her name! man she is arrogant, zero customer service, miserable, never helped. I ended up taking my parcel back so I won’t have to deal with her. She must have hated her job so much. At least have some friendly and good customer service etiquette people to work at the front desk not a miserable one."
,Sherry Telle,1,"There is no excuse for the way the main employee treats people, there is a younger girl who is very nice, but I don't see her often. The short older lady is rude and beyond slow. I only go here if a parcel has been left, and I purposely do not have anything shipped CP as it will end up here, they don't ever leave a parcel at the door, just the dreaded note. I go to the Shoppers off of Memorial and 52nd to ship anything as the staff is so much better. That Shoppers gets my business, prescriptions and all  now because of the one postal worker here."
,Sarah Royle,1,"If you hate your job that much, maybe you should work somewhere else. I have been there 3 times in the past month,  for various reasons, and each time I have been given poor customer service and just overall lack of any sense that they care that this is an essential service. Maybe hire more friendly, capable people."
,Sharla Parry,2,"I am forced to go to this post office because Canada Post did not deliver my package to my office.
CostIng me taxi fare as I do not drive.

The lady is very slow and not overly pleasant.
Go early especially at Christmas as line up is long and slow moving.
Usually someone in line who is still packing a box or addressing an envelope."
,Oshyn U,1,"Terrible and rude customer service. Every time I go to drop off a package, I end up waiting for 10-20 minutes before being helped. They are short staffed and current staff is staff. They need to get better people to work at these post offices."
,Vicky Tran,1,"The lady with the short hair has the worst customer service here! I come here often to drop off shipments and she always seems like she hates her job. Not once have I ever been acknowledged with a hello or thank you.

The last time I came here, the QR code for my shipping label was not working so I couldn’t print it. I asked her to make me a new label and she said she wasn’t able to, responsed with a “oh no I can’t do that here” excuse me? Isn’t that a part of your job? What about the people that don’t know how to  use technology or make their own labels at home? This is pure laziness!!"
,Laura Foster,4,"The workers are helpful but am afraid to go to them sometimes ,because they sound so mean. Never with a smile 😃 so serious..I feel like am walking into court and not a post office..So decided to go to another post office...this one is stressful."
,Ruth Oruh,1,"Extremely is an understatement,  I wish I could find an adjective worse than this. But the delivery service is *EXTREMELY Poor*. An express package sent on October 08, 2022 to Mississauga at the immigration was only delivered yesterday  October 17, 2022. Meanwhile the envelope was picked up on October 11, 2022
So what is  the essence of paying more inorder to get your mail facilitated/get delivered faster? This is fraud and a scam of of services. Stealing from people. You take money and don't offer the services the money is meant for."
,Suzanne Plett,1,"Extrememly poor delivery service!!!! The delivery driver is to lazy to drive to the back of our location T1Y 7J8 to deliver the mail as ALL other delivery companies do.
We have to spend money on getting a Canada Post Box and pay to have it mounted in order to get any service.
I strongly recommend using any other delivery service."
,Lakhwinder Mann,1,"One employee on duty on Saturday April 9th and she was on some sort break and mad at least 10 people to wait in line to get their service done.
Horrible post office at shoppers falcon ridge area NE Calgary."
,Sediqullah Sarwary,4,"A kind lady is always there to help, I don’t know her name Sorry. Today I visited again, I had the same good experience. 5 stars for the kind lady’s friendly behavior.

But, sometimes they are short staffed and customers have to wait for a little while, the management could fill this gap, it’s just a kind request. That’s why 4 stars in general.
Other than that it’s one of the best Canada post service providers in the area.
Thanks"
,April Panganiban,1,"WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE. LADY AT CANADA POST (FALCONRIDGE, CALGARY). I BELIEVE THE NAME WAS JEN, AND SHE WAS EXTREMELY RUDE. DID NOT LISTEN TO MY CONCERNS, INSTEAD, SHE WOULD ALWAYS CUT ME OFF WHILE SPEAKING AND TOLD ME TO CONTACT THE 1800 NUMBER TO COMPLAIN. IF YOU TRULY HATE YOUR JOB, QUIT!"
,Steven Kopke,1,"Absolutely disgusting. Joan was rude and condescending to a customer  in front of me just because she had challenges in English. The folk behind me were even disgusted. This customer was doing a money gram. Whilst doing it, Joan proceeded to place a prepared sign to say the system was down. Joan my question to you, if the system was down how were you able to complete the money gram after placing the sign up, or just do not want to do them."
,Harmanpreet Singh,1,"Aug 28 ,2022 .Lady at front , refused to process my mail forwarding (just an edit on existing application) . I was in line since 5.35 pm (closes 6pm)  . At 5.54 she said  she cant do it would take her some time. she is closing. She could have told me that while I was in line . She was very slow and not so respectful of my time.  What about my time you wasted . She said come back again tommorow again , like am not working just free for you to come again tomorow."
,Deanna Paton,3,"Usually very good but the last 2 times I have tried to ship something it's been impossible and iv had to find a new shipping station. Had questions and needed help yes no solutions were offered. Just statement of the problem. It use to be if you had an issue or a questions, they worked hard to help you out and I appreciated that."
,Rose Driscoll,1,"If I could give them 0 I would. The drivers don't care about delivering your packages, just about how fast they can hit that delivered notification then drive off so they finish their route faster without dropping anything off. Irresponsible, blatant disregard for that they are doing."
,Aaron Rogers,5,"Tammy's level of customer care and expertise is exactly what people need.  Thanks to her diligence, she saved me from owing several hundred dollars in a shipping dispute that I wouldn't have been prepared for.  Keep up the good work Tammy"
,Ozlem Mihyaz,3,Our community mail box keys were given to the wrong person so we were worried about our privacy and confidential mails which we were expecting. They followed up with us the issue and solved it next day
,mariela zamorarios,5,"Post Canada ❤Amazing experience today with the lady in front, short hair (white color) October 30 , 2019 6;15 pm.  She help me with my bad english to get  help with money gram agent.  So patience, very kind and great professional.  So glad to find people that she love her work and is ready to get answers.  Thank you so much 🙏❤🙋🏼‍♀️ sheryn is her name I believe"
,Jone,5,"Great experience. The young guy is very nice, good service, no line up, in and out very quickly."
,Anna Friesen,5,Staff are friendly and even when there is a line they keep it moving pretty quickly. Great for quickly shipping a package. Only think that I would like to see is an external mailbox but they have one that is open as long as Shoppers is open right by the post office so its not far out of the way.
,Maan Mesmeh,5,Social Distancing is in place and employees are very pleasant.
,Leo Yeung,4,"Compare to other CP outlets, this one seems to be the most reasonable. They sort their inbound mail within two hours, so you can your parcel if you wait until late afternoon. When most CP outlets sorts their mail in only in the evening, two-hours is relatively reasonable. Friendly staff, helpful, and virtually no line-up any time of the day."
,Lis Marie,5,This is my go-to Canada post! They are always friendly there and really helpful and I never have to wait long to be helped. I trust this location a lot and it's always clean and an enjoyable experience!
,bonnie lisbon,1,"unreal ""service"" (i hesitate to even call it that). i tried calling them by connecting through london drugs' phone #, and i got an automated message that said the post office hours and then said ""if you're receiving this message during business hours, we're busy helping others. please call back later"" and hung up, didn't even put me on hold, just hung up. i figured they might be busy so i went to the post office and surprise! it was EMPTY.

canada post kept re-routing my package (even though ive never had this issue in the past, and the company i bought from has shipped me things several times), and i went in asking for clarification.

the lady who ""helped"" me seemed just as confused as me which would've been fine if she wasn't literally the team leader. she even tried telling me it's my mistake for having put the wrong address when again, ive never had this issue (my address is in the company file).

she told me to ""wait two days"" and gave me a number to call if it doesn't show up. she offered zero help or at least to call a higher up that could actually help me.

this place is a joke. actually, scratch that, canada post in general is a joke."
,Care Bear,1,"I’m gonna call her out… I believe her name is Donna C, short middle aged grey hair woman. Acts somewhat friendly but I know she’s been working there for a long time because I’ve dealt with her a few years ago and was actually really nice to deal with at the time. Recently I went in and was upset. It was the same lady but this time she couldn’t find my package, using the address on my drivers licence. I had to leave and come back with my delivery notice slip which I forgot to bring with me but I know in the past, it wasn’t an issue. Reading other peoples reviews, it looks like it’s not the first time she has done this.  I hope management or a higher up will talk to her about this. And if she really doesn’t know, then she needs to be trained properly but if you’ve been working there for a long time then I would expect you to know how to find things. My address was clearly on the label too with my name which is also on my license. So no excuses! Like I said I know she is not a new employee; If she was new then I wouldn’t leave this bad review."
,Hilary Buckley,4,Went in to ship a single small package around noon today and the employee working took the time to patiently show me the price difference between sending as a Parcel and a Flat Rate Box. I was quite surprised that the second option was less expensive and grateful that the employee cared enough to show me that so I could make an informed and economical decision rather than just charging me for the Parcel.
,Dillon,5,"Despite what others have said, there must have been a change in staffing here recently. I have had great experiences at this Canada post and regularly use them for my business."
,Krista Nicole,1,"The prepaid bin is on the ground right in the path when you get in line and I tripped on it and almost fell and instead of concern the lady said ""oh well no one else has ever tripped or complained about it""! Also, often tracking says my packages are there and they claim they haven't received it yet. Overall bad attitudes and service. I wouldn't go here at all if the delivery drivers would actually put my packages in the buildings package drop off spot."
,Alexia Alex,1,The Filipinal lady should learn how to do customer service. She does not fit this job. She's always look like mad without you do any things to her.
,Val Faracì,5,I like using this Canada Post location. It is close. The staff are friendly and efficient. I do a lot of parcel shipping for my small business and I've never had any problems. Everything goes 2 day Expedited.
,Carissa Schmidtke,1,"Its too bad I never have a good experience coming to this location. But I do wish the Filipina who works there a better existence. She is never happy when I see her, times are tough right now so I do have compassion, but she needs to leave her sourness at the door. It's very bad for business."
,Steve Dion,2,"Not thrilled that every day here is bring-your-kid-to-work day, but today was extra-special because the kid was not just in attendance, but he was actually WORKING alongside his mom/caregiver.
I get that some people are in a difficult position on occasion, but hey, you decided to breed.  Find a solution.
Sorry, but I don't think the clumsy child that is normally there playing a 🎮 should be handling my potentially fragile delivered packages, operating the Canada Post computer or ringing up anyone's bills.
Does Canada Post encourage child labour???
This same woman is slow enough as it is because she (used to) insist on typing out all the serial numbers instead of scanning the barcode, saying the scanner didn't work (it does, had another employee use it without an iota of difficulty).
Two stars is generous."
,Raki Saionji,1,"From adobo karen to a grumpy old man, attendants here are pretty dramatic to work with. Their hospitality are non-existent."
,keith yung,1,"Terrible service. Tried opening a PO, after multiple visit getting all the requested paper work in order requested by Robin, the previous day when she reviewed all of the documents provided, I was told that I am unable to open the PO box as the paper she reviewed the day before were not satisfactory. Took 5 visits to figure this out…when it could have pointed out to me the on the first visit."
,Gary Morris,4,Thank you to Sana for taking care of my MoneyGram issue she promised she would fix it and she did !  Great work and customer service in a stressful situation.
,Dmytro Larionov,2,"Working hours wasn’t updated for 3 of July. In Google maps still till 9 pm, it store - till 2 pm"
,Top Soccer VidsHD,2,"I went to go mail a few items for my father who lives out of province, however the package was overweight so I had to take out some things. I was about to pay for a bubble parcel to send his mail to him as well as the other things but leave out somethings as it wouldn't fit. The fee for the bubble parcel would have been 25 dollars, the same as paying for another flat rate box and being able to fit his mail and the other things that would've been left out. The one who was attending to me, her name was Lynn. I told her about my situation and she was just being vague with me, and she was watching me as I was about to pay 25 dollars just to ship his mail until I came to the idea to get a flat rate box and just ship everything. Lynn was going to let me take some of the stuff I was meant to send to my dad back home instead of giving me an option that would benefit him.  Horrible customer service as she didn't provide me with cheaper options. However, Scott who was working at the time too, was very customer friendly and made the experience better. If he wasn't there this would have gotten one star."
,Kayla Richard,5,Robin was very helpful and professional. She helped me to find a cost effective way to send some items to my daughter. I really appreciated her efforts.
,Gagandeep Kaur,1,"Very very rude girl with short curly hair, working on July 15th, Saturday 5.05pm shift. She needs to go back for training, specifically customer service. I would love to rate zero if there is any option. I gave 1 star because I didn't have any choice"
,Xav La,5,"The woman with black bob hairstyle and white stripes deserves a raise , she worked so so well under pressure . There was still a big line and she went out of her way to help me even though she didn’t really have to… thankful for her service ."
,Jack liu,1,Was going pickup a package from the post.i think the old lady name rose dont like me lmao.  i show her the pickup notice card that they left on door.  Even the payment receipt and the receipt that include the tracking number that my friend send to me.  She wont let me pickup the package. Waste 30 mins and miss my bus. Worstest day
,Stuart Singer,5,Hard to give 5 stars to Canada post but I have to say the staff work hard and fast at this location.
,Gavin Wong,4,"The service here is actually quite good if you walk in knowing 2 things: exactly what you need from them and that they understand the system far better than you do.

The older woman that works here is clearly competent at her job. I once returned some telecom equipment and she advised me to email them the tracking number receipt to receive my deposit back earlier. I've watched her clearly lay out the options and give informed recommendations to those sending packages.

Only 4/5 stars because this place is clearly overworked and understaffed (as per usual)."
,Tancred,2,"While the lady running the place today was likely doing her best, she was filling in from a different department, she’s clearly not been trained to do the work she’s being asked to do, she was polite and I genuinely felt bad that she was stuck in the position she was in.

But the whole interaction was just one fumble after another. I finally did get my package. There were instructions for me to pick up the package, my name was on the package which was a gift sent to me by a friend. I had the barcode and ID , but didn’t have ID of the sender. She told me I had to either come with the person who sent it, or come with something showing the same addresss as the sender ??? Doesn’t make sense.
Then told me to come back Monday or call Canada post.

I told her there were instructions to allow me to pick up the parcel and she said there was someone else’s name identified to pick it up, so I clarified my first and last name and then I assume she realized it was mine itself, but said the system had my name incorrect but my ID matched the parcel.

Line up was growing so that was my last attempt, thankfully she did give me my parcel all in all, so I’m making this two stars instead of the one star id started off this review with."
,Ara Shimoon,5,"Probably the nicest people on Earth. I say probably because the actual nicest person on Earth is my mom.
Kensington Post Office are kind, knowledgeable, helpful, and they take their time with you to make sure you have the best service."
,Bryce,1,Their mail carriers around the area skip apartment deliveries by pre writing their delivery notice slips. Then it can takes multiple days for the parcel to show up at this post office. That is if you can convince the person behind the counter that your package is supposed to be there. I've tried by best to work with these guys but even their website runs you around in circles till you find their support number.
,Momi Salamiah,1,"I came two days in  a row to pick up parcel, they keep saying it's not  here yet. A day before, they told me it will be here in the morning. They don't know how to resolve the situation or try to give an advice for not to keep coming back for nothing. They just simply said it's not here yet!! So what's the notification for when the exact date and time been checked on it."
,aemarsfan,5,"This is a great place to drop off parcels and sometimes pick up parcels too! The people that work here seem to know what they are doing, they certainly know more about postage than I do. The location is great also - right on Kensington Road."
,Christina Raj,1,"The staff are usually friendly and helpful, but last evening there was the most grim looking employee of canada post I've ever met - Tianna. No greeting no hello no smile - nothing. Can someone please train her on customer service skills?! ThAnk you."
,And Hi,2,Received a card on my door today so stopped by to pick up what was here. There was no one in line and two clerks yet they couldn’t even bother to look for two seconds to grab my package. No. Come back either this evening or tomorrow.. cause you know… my time isn’t worth anything right. Unreal. And lazy!
,F D,5,"The lady that helped me with my express post today was professional, patient, awesome and very helpful. She seems to be European, but I did not catch her name. I saw her attend to two people before me. She never lost a beat. She was extremely kind. She was there at around 5.30 pm on Thursday 10th March 2020 when I went there. We need more people like this at Canada post locations."
,J J (JJ),1,"One of the clerks insisted that I had to get stuff picked up by Canada Post Truck even though it is not available in my area. Threatened to deny service for dropping my items that needs to be shipped even though all packages are already ready to be shipped and paid for. Very bad customer service and I'm glad there are other locations are more friendlier than this place.

UPDATE: Issue has been discussed with Canada Post Officials and has said these issues were addressed with the staff but guess what, I came back with a small packet and God forbid one of the employee says that I need to print a manifest (A FOUR PAGE MANIFEST) for me to ship this one item that was pre-paid for and the tag printed already. What a joke."
,Garry Slater,5,"Deb was so friendly and knowledgeable, very helpful in our foreign passport application. Canada Post is great at this location! Thank you so much Deb"
,Areeb Ashar,1,"Extremely bad service. Avoid this location. Jereyl J here is to be avoided, has an attitude problem to me and other customers. Made me carry packages 2 kilometers walking to tell me to take them back because she doesn't feel like doing her job. Avoid at all costs."
,JThomsen,1,"Had a pretty bad experience dealing with Jeryle. I was standing behind an elderly lady who was trying to mail a letter. The woman working there, Jeryle, kept on rolling her eyes because the elderly lady was being slow. She was talking to that elderly lady with such a condescending tone and disgusted facial expression.

It just looks like she doesn’t want to be working at the post office, and she is above it, like she should be working a more “worthy” job.

Somebody needs to fire this person, she doesn’t deserve this job. There are lots of friendly and capable people in this city."
,Robbie Jay,1,"The people who work here are always helpful. My 1 star rating isn't a beef with them.

I understand COVID has messed things up, but I doubt it's hard to update your hours. On the card that was left, Google, and the email that I received it states that you are open until 9pm. I get that those cards were printed by the thousands and can't be easily updated. Fine. But update your correspondence and website please! It has been months! I have live plants to pick up and would have rushed over there to get them before close if I had actually known what time that was. Do better."
,Stephanie Brunelle,5,"The service was great. I showed up unprepared and the two ladies working that day were very knowledgeable and went above and beyond, working together to try and fit all of my items into as few boxes as possible. Probably the best service I've ever received, great experience."
,Tim Godin,5,I mailed something here. The line was long. I waited a while. So pretty much exactly like every other post office ever. Was exactly what I expected and wanted. Will be back. I'm only writing this because I was surprised its stars were so low for no apparent reason.
,Steeltoecashflow,1,The girl with the blue hair that wears the big “pride vibes” rainbow pin on her work shirt is very rude with little knowledge of how to do her job. I’ll be finding a new post office to take my regular business.
,alex smtih,5,I haven’t mailed anything since a letter to Santa as a child so I was really struggling with the address formatting. The post office is always quite busy but in between rushes an employee-i think her name was Deanna-took a minute to help me to do it correctly. Great customer service.
,Kayla Pilon,1,"I’ve continually had awful experiences at this location to the point where I will drive out of my way to go to a different location. The people working there won’t help with simple questions and are just plain rude. Currently going to another post office just to get help because I was dismissed. Very frustrating.
The one exception is a younger gentleman with dark hair who is extremely patient and consistent."
,Aidan O'Brien-Moran,1,Computer system was down so they refused to give me my package then I came all the way back and they refused again because my ID doesn’t have an updated address.  Useless post office.  Avoid Canada Post at all costs their customer service has really degraded over the last few years.
,Ig Tre,5,They have been really good to me over the years.
,Purva (Lonely),2,The girl working in afternoon shift on Wednesday april 5 was the most rude person I have seen. I don't understand why people have to be that rude 😒 she literally said ohh next time please provide full name just your initials PT is not helpful. So what should I take out of this? Is asking me to make her job easier? You any I don't care what the intention was but this is not a acceptable. Customers don't want to hear things like even if it was in good intention. She wasn't helping me anyways so why was she nosy when the other person was helping me. She should just minded her own business. I am giving 2 stars just because of the guy helped nicely. This posy office location lost 3 stars from me because of that ride girl. Never coming back to the location.
,Love Gill,1,"I had to collect my money from this location and i went there first time and they refused to provide the money as they don’t have sufficient funds. I went there again and again they gave me the same excuse and told me to come early in the morning, then I went there third time and they still refused and gave me the same excuse of insufficient funds. It was only $700 and they never had it. Worst service I’ve ever experienced.
If you’re collecting or sending money via this location I highly suggest don’t use their services unless you’re willing to waste a lot of time."
,Chrono Cross,1,"Ah yes...hiring the cheapest form of labor you can.  From grumpy old philipono lady who talks more than she listens to young philopino teenagers squawking with each other in tagalog while customers standing there waiting for service.  ""Canada"" post the new face of ""customer service"""
,Rohan Trivedi,1,"I am the kind of person that would never review anything but I am doing it for tne first time so just think how awful they are and how much mad they made me, this guy i called just before closing asked him politely if he can stay 5 more minutes after closing as i was on my way to the post office from wainwright as the parcel was for my brother and he is out of town for next month and i have no one here , i was just 5 minutes from the post office and this guy was like no i cant do that, i asked him many times, requested him, but he refused to listen, i know i understand that you have to follow certain protocol but at that moment i felt and i still feel that 5 minutes wouldn’t make a difference if he stayed for me. I am more frustrated about the part that he was not even listening to me."
,Melissa Doroshenko,1,"If I could give 0, I would.

Canada post has always been inconsistent.

I sent a package with them, insured, because the item I was sending was worth $500.

When the item was never delivered to the destination and I called with all the information they simply told me my case was closed and there was nothing they could do.

Also, I've expected express deliveries on a certain day and they have been several days late.

Don't waste your time and money.  Go for a more reliable shipping/ receiving company!!"
,The Best,5,"This review is specifically for PO .In the midst of very difficult circumstances, Sheryn(Po manager) here provides absolutely first-class customer service every time . I can not thank her enough for the support and professionalism she shows. Many thanks indeed."
,Jashan Toor,1,I went there to receive my parcel today. The girl name nav she was really rude. She really didn’t know how to talk to their customers.
,美亜,3,"I used to receive great service from this post office. Unfortunately they hired some new workers and one of them just has a very lack lustre attitude. I send and receive quite a lot of mail regularly, so I'm familiar with both procedures. On more than one occasion this new employee has   had an ""I don't care"" attitude, which makes going to this post office such a hassle."
,Daisy Switzer,1,They simply refuse to answer the phone. Been waiting on the line for 25 minutes now. Canada Post lost one of my packages and their suggestion was to call the post offices in my area and see if they had it (instead of me physically driving around to each one in the neighbourhood). Looks like I will have to drive around to each one after all.
,Matthew Sookraj,1,The worker was on break for longer than the sign said. I had to get other employee to find them. Very unhelpful in finding my package.
,JingYi Chen,5,"I’ve been going to this post office at least once a week, every week, for over a year now, and the staff have (usually)always been helpful, quick, and knowledgeable with what I needed. Drop offs went smoothly, buying stamps, sending registered mail, picking packages up all great. I’ve had minimal bad experiences! I think for the most part people will treat you with respect and patience, as long as you treat them with the same respect they deserve :)"
,040mobil,5,"Needing to send money by moneygram for family involved in a car accident in the Philippines, I made a last minute dash to the Skyview location. When my debit wouldnt work, Maddie stayed open past 5 to let me run to a bank and get the balance of money to send. Can't say thank you enough!"
,Wesam Khalfalla,5,"Friendly staff, awesome service!

Thanks Mrs Elaine!"
,Kitschy Devil,3,"Staff here is normally very helpful, I sent my husband here today to grab some stamps and mail something for me. It's an oversized envelope to the USA, as per the Canada post website, it's $3.19, the person working said it had to go as a parcel which I know is untrue, I've been mailing these envelopes for years, and I also used to work for Canada post myself. I called the store to discuss, I was told I was wrong. Hubby went to another Canada post location, and they mailed it just fine. Inconvenient for us."
,Angie B,5,"I had a great experience at this location today. It was quite busy, and all of the staff were very friendly and efficient at helping everyone. I wish I had caught the name of the women who helped me with shipping my parcels. She was so nice and patient in helping me choose the best options. Usually going to the post office is kind of a drag, but with staff like this it's a pleasant experience!"
,Lindsey Kjaldgaard,5,"Highly recommend coming to this location. I have been a regular customer here for the past year, and can say with certainty that every single employee is friendly and goes above and beyond for you. Leslie is FANTASTIC, but really everyone at this location is amazing and deserves 5 stars."
,Niraja Roy,5,"I am Nirmala, resident of Edmonton, I have been using 162, Bonnie Doon  postal services since the beginning of early 1990s with no complaints or issues. I found Ann Marie, manager, her loyal, dedicated staff , Leslie, Chantal, Melissa, Julia and other part time and casual helpers have been providing exceptional customer service day in and day out. I have been to other postal outlets and I am confident and very happy to say Bonnie Doon postal staff has many strengths such as, their excellent time management skills, no matter how long  the line ups are, how busy they get, how many different types of postal needs the customers have on any given day...they have been providing very good service with welcoming smiles on their faces. I did see and notice on some occasions in the past 40 years, very few customers were rude, abrupt , demanding and unreasonable to the most hardworking, loyal, knowledgeable and well  trained Bonnie Doon postal staff, I did feel it was unfair, I truly do not agree with the saying "" Customer is always right."" Any employee who works in the retail industry deserves respect, empathy and gratitude from customers from all walks of life. However, I have noticed many customers who access Bonnie Doon postal services including me  are appreciative and grateful for the services we get . I wish the owners, managers, pharmacists and the postal staff the best in 2023 and years to follow."
,Meriam Montesa,1,"The lady puts me on hold for 10mins,and then someone picked up the phone but saying it is not the post office so he transferred me to the post office department but then someone answered telling me it is not the post office department. They transferred me again,the lady i first talked to answered. Me asking how's her day going,if they're busy. She said yeah and asked me sarcastically if she can put me on hold so she can assist her customer. Question is,AM I NOT A CUSTOMER?!didn't even ask why i called,geez!"
,Kaitlyn,5,"The staff here are always great! They do their best to move through everyone as quickly as possible. It can sometimes get a little busy, so be prepared to wait sometimes! They have a small counter in the side where you can place pre paid packages which is always nice! Very convenient"
,Ysil,1,"Canada post has to be he worst delivery service on the planet. Attempt to deliver at 11 am, and now I need to wait more than 24 hours to pickup my package? Complete garbage."
,A.J. Keller,5,Stopped by on a Wednesday night about a half hour before close. It was busy. I didn't get the employees name but they were very friendly and efficient. I feel that the service was fast but I don't think any of the customers felt rushed. Just terrific.
,A. D,5,I’ve been to this location several times. I just didn’t get her name but everytime we go there she is the one who happens to assist me. She is always so nice and accommodating. It is so good to see people like her happy and loves what she is doing. Next time I go there I will ask for her name because she really needs a recognization. Such a lovely lady.
,Diana Nguyen,1,Went in there to pick up a $222 package to pick up and I brought in a valid Id and receipt proving that the package was mine. But they kept on refusing me as I went there twice try to prove to them even more. So I just gave up on the package. Those people there if they have a bad mood they are going to put there mood on to you as they want to see people suffer as there were others on the line struggling like me. After the deadline of picking up the package it was sent to my door without any notice when you are supposed to sign a form because the package is for adults. If an child picked that package up it would very bad on there part as it would illegal. What Canada post did was very unprofessional and very illegal what they did as they are lazy and single moms.
,Madison Côté,5,"Great and quick customer service, especially during the holidays. Still took the time to answer people’s questions and keep it moving quickly and I really appreciated that they found the best solutions for the folks ahead of me in line rather than just taking their money and sending them on their way. I didn’t catch her name, but the younger brunette woman is a rockstar!"
,kayla shanks,1,"If I could give no stars I would. We went there and a older woman and a younger girl were working and we had a package from embark dna that needed to be sent to them. Stamps are already on it so we were good to go so we thought. First they said they can't accept USPS and said to find the nearest location. Well the nearest location is in the states so how exactly does that work? So I went back and she's like oh yeah we can send that you just need to fill out this QR customs form and we were under the impression we could just do that customs form when we got home, she took our package without saying that the customs form needs to go with the package so then we had to go all the way back and I just grabbed my package and left. You guys seriously need to train your employees better this was absolutely embarrassing on your end."
,Judy,1,I agree with all the bad reviews from customers!!  I’ve stopped going there and now go to Shoppers!!  I CAN NOT believe that Canada Post would allow this place to be a Post Office. What do we need to do to bring this to Canada Post Attention?  I’ve had several parcels over the years that were supposedly lost and never made it to address!!!  Even government envelopes I mailed and was never received at address. I HATE that my parcels that was to come to my address are taken to this store for me to pick up!!!  I’d rather they go to my nearest Shoppers Drug Post Office!!
,Rostyslav Lomaha,1,"If I would be able to rate it “-5” stars I would do it.

Unprofessional and unfriendly staff, they can't even answer your questions properly because their English is just awful.

How they were hired- is a mystery to me, but the image they are making for Canada post will have a really bad impact.

Save your time and do not visit this post office."
,Abduush Ibrahim,1,"This location is open late and that’s how I found out it existed.

The staff are extremely unprofessional and barely give you any information that might be useful or relevant.
They don’t respond to your questions properly.
Their focus is collecting money from the customers.
Awful customer service."
,Tracy Campbell,1,"Unbelievably rude. I took something in that I had previously priced out by weight, dimensions and international rate on Canada Post.ca.  I also brought in the downloaded and approved Customs form for each envelope from CP.  Without even weighing the envelopes, the woman told me that they would cost me $10 each and that they were parcels. I tried to explain that I had already spoken with Canada Post and that the paperwork with the barcode would prove that and she started yelling at me telling me that they were parcels and I had to pay $10 for them. I asked her to stop raising her voice and tried, once again, to explain that the barcodes from Canada Post would confirm the price, but she refused to scan them or look at them.  This place is ridiculous. They need to lose their license as a registered CP post office."
,Ryan Hanna,1,"This place is less of a post office and more a menagerie of clowns.  Poorly organized, unable to communicate and having extreme difficulty offering basic services.

It is unfortunate that there is not more government oversight."
,Destiny Hilton,5,I love this location! I have been to many for our business and have not had good experiences! Candy is so beyond helpful! She helps make sure my packages are secure. She circles where each of my packages can be tracked. She’s very detailed! I send multiple at a time so I feel grateful that she is patient and swift. She looks at best options and she’s so beyond kind! This will be my forever go to location! Candy you rock!!
,Jatinder Dhillon,1,"worst experience of my life , I booked priority service to send passport to Toronto as per the service should deliver next day .
But they lost passport I tried to call helpline nobody knows where my package. I went to this location to just make sure they sent my package but lady who is working there really don’t want to help me just look around.

By ended  I lost passport canada post not taking any responsibility. Please don’t send any important documents by Canada post pay little extra money use FedEx or DHL ."
,Zahra Rashid,1,"If I could give them 0 stars I would. Horrible customer service. The lady at this location told me she would hold my parcel till a certain day and when I go there physically to pick it up the front desk clerk tells me your parcel is not here, it’s already sent back to the sender. What a waste of my time and gas money. This location has too many bad reviews, management should look into this. Very disappointed."
,Amanpreet Kaur,1,I went today(22feb2022) at 5:20 pm. There was a lady. She was so rude and she had no sense how to deal with customers. I was very dissatisfied from the service. Do train your staff focusing how to behave and tell them what customer service really is.
,Surgical Steel,1,"About 20 min ago, Jun/23/21 I met the most rude, impatient and ignorant postal clerk I've ever met.
This office is usually quite pleasant to patronize but today the - blonde haired, sleeve tattooed female, who wore spectacles was just plain rude.
(The description I give is for identification, I love blondes and tattoos)

Suffice it to say I will strictly avoid ever using this post office again to ensure I do not have to deal with such a snotty clerk whom gave awful service.
Mailing something or asking for their (assumed) expertise shouldn't be so unpleasant."
,Jenny Fer,1,"This place always had good service untill jul25/2023 at 2:00pm when one employee made fun of me gave me attitude told me to go on the side to tape my boxes and losing my spot by the time 2 people in front of me didnt lose theirs in line! And after that another lady comes and say i dont even have to wait!
Rude and disrespectful! She doesnt know how to talk to people! Zero social she should work in a spot where she doesnt interact with people!"
,Juliana W,2,"I frequent here lots and most times it’s good. But I’m confused how one employee can give me a price for sending a letter, taking my envelope and weighing it, to be charged more when I go to the till to a different employee? To be charged for an oversized letter when there was no more than 10 pages in my envelope. How did the weight change from one person to the next? & when I asked to clarify why it was changed, he said the thickness??? One person things it’s thick, the other doesn’t and the weight is changing? Weird."
,Ken Beaton,1,"New System Day,
Walk in,  looks nice,  clerk at front counter says they are having system issues,  directs me to the back through the drive through.
Once I get there.  I am told that they have too many packages here at the moment. The lady imposed that because of the amount of packages she is unwilling to help me. The response from drive through lady was super unprofessional.  I was told to just come back later or try tomorrow.
What an inconvenience."
,Take And Make,5,"This Canada Post office is absolutely amazing! On top of it it's unique! First of all it has Drive Through, only two locations in Canada could boast of this, one is here in Edmonton, another in Toronto. Yes, you can stop by and do all your mail needs without leaving the vehicle!
Second awesome option, there is 2 sweet machines which works 24/7. One of them sells stamps, envelopes and gifts, which is quite handy. The other one can take your parcel! Only 3 locations in Canada have this machine! Toronto, Edmonton and Vancouver!
This is the Future of the Postal Service! Way to go Canada Post! This machine even gives you 10% discount on shipping if you use it. You could ship anything from 500 grams to 30 kg. How cool is that?"
,Ken Varias,5,"It was a little too slow when I came to this location to drop off my package. I understand that they are changing to the new system which is awesome. We have to. Be patient people! They are trying their best to improve the service. By the way, the lady that assisted me is very nice. Thanks!"
,ahmed,5,"Had to ship a package overseas, saw the rates online and was ready to pay but  Marissa provided me with cheaper and better alternatives. Definitely would be back here for my shipping needs!"
,菜鸡互啄,1,"This Canada post won't provide a tape. I am not asking to wrap the whole box, I just need to seal the top. I had to go home and come back. Really inconvenience. A shipping company doesn't have a tape, this is part of your working supply. The owner is really cheap."
,Pnitram,1,"Went here yesterday for last minute shipping. The indian girl at the counter was so rude and condescending. She couldn’t find the address/postal code and won’t ship my item.
so she just acted rude, set me aside, then proceeded to treated me badly (she helped other costumers and ignored me while I was WAITING for her help.)

Fire that b!tch. Bad for business."
,Gerry Dai,5,Had the friendliest encounter with Marisa up front! She helped send along my package when I was in a rush! Great service.
,Wilson Recto,5,"Hi, we have a business  acount with canada post, we have  been dropping -off  our package at this location james watts, for so many years. I would like say thank you Mr. Karan he’s always help me  all the the time when i go there.  He’s was wonderful and very accommodating. Thank you"
,Hippie Tech,4,"Living in the area for a very long time I frequented this place sometimes daily. They were always courteous and kind, and all my packages got where they needed to be. Heck I even used to ship out dozens of packages for my business there weekly. Postal is postal, there's going to be issues sometimes. But in over 10 years, I can't think of a time they were overly rude or unprofessional. Sometimes there are lines of 10-20+ people snaking into the store, and they still move people along pretty fast."
,Simon Fallon,1,The lady who works here most days is condescending every single time. She should be shipped to the back of a warehouse where she doesn’t have to be seen by the general public.
,Mark man,4,"Seems to work fine. I’ve never spent more than 8 minutes there while doing my stuff.
Rough neighborhood, but they don’t control that."
,Newton's Ghost,2,"i took a package to this post office, to the girl at the front desk. i had a buyer that was interested in knowing the cost of shipping. i gave the girl the address to send to, and she gave me the price. i returned home and relayed the price to the buyer, he agreed to buy. i return the next day to the same post office and the same girl, and this time when she inputs in the the same address as the previous day, she says it doesn't exist on her computer. why did it exist the previous day? or why didn't she tell me that then? the address was correct, i verified it. yet, if her computer is in error, she should have told me the first day instead of wasting my time, so i didn't have to drive home and recontact the buyer. i could have done that after the first time when she originally weighed it."
,Matt W,1,"Delivery ""attempt"" fails conveniently on a Friday afternoon at 4pm that's I'm specifically waiting for... Takes until Tuesday the next week to even have the opportunity to pick up.

You make DHL look compitent 🤦‍♂️

Update: delivery notice showed up multiple days AFTER I had to go pickup my package. Peak incompitentce"
,James Valdez,1,"This store specifically, stole two of my package was worth $2,500 for a shoe.
So what happen is, I shipped the shoe and it was size 10.5 and when it arrived it was already size 10, and my other shoe it never arrived.
Please just go to other store or they might stole your package.

Thief"
,Frank Macchione,1,I was quoted a price of $23.00 over the phone by a female to ship a package and went to the store she quoted $65.00 by the same female.  If you make a mistake it’s your fault and let the customer have it at the original price. Not my fault you messed up. I asked for a manager and got nothing. Customer service and knowledge is lacking at this location. Just a heads up on how you get treated!
,Chacl B,5,Always a convenient place to pick up my parcels. Much better than FedEx or UPS who require me to drive across the city. Sometimes lines are long but it's usually the customers who aren't prepared causing the hold up. Never had to wait excessively long and i can always leave and come back another time. It's not busy every hour of the day. Staff are usually happy to help and some even remember us by name. I wish ALL my shipping needs could be handled by Canada Post.
,Anthony Fok,5,"Not sure what problems other have run into, but my experience with this Canada Post office (inside Shoppers Drug Mart) has been very pleasant.  The lady there has always been courteous and helpful, and I look forward to visiting there, either to mail my posts or to receive packages.

Also, this post office must be getting popular too, as my last few visits there, there were often a line-up with 3 or 4 people ahead of me, and I had to wait in line for 5 to 10 minutes.  But it was probably because I was visiting during peak hours?"
,Mark Blemings,5,"I ship through this Canada Post almost on a weekly basis. Ya, sometimes there is a line but that is not the fault of the ladies at the counter. They are all so friendly and I've got to know them quite well. People who are complaining about long wait times need to either go at different hours of quit their whining because there is nothing more the staff can do. Some times people just want to hear them selves complain and to be heard doing it.  I feel sorry for everyone have had to deal with these loser customers."
,Arielle Mavridis,3,"A small Canada post office that is located inside the Shoppers Drug Mart on Jasper Avenue. Very clean and well organized. They offer stamps, shipping packages, and they have P.O. Boxes available to rent. The staff are great at this location, though they are understaffed and should be working two people at a a time so they can take breaks without leaving the counter unattended. It does get quite busy as there is only one till open at a time so the lines can form quite quickly at this location so do not go here if you are in a big rush. I use this post office constantly and have never had an issue with a package or service, it has always been helpful. They are located in the far back right corner of the store."
,Manuell M,5,"Been going to this Canada Post now for 7 months. Angelita has been outstanding and incredibly consistent. I always visit during the morning hours.. so I am not sure about the other workers but if you are looking for exceptional service, professionalism, and just a great overall experience see Angelita and she'll happily assist! Highly recommend this location. Thank you again for the ongoing service throughout the years! I look forward to many more interactions :)

Manny"
,Trouty McTroutTrout,3,The store is not bad actually. Has some food and a pharmacy area as well as a postal outlet. The 2 stars knocked off are for the postal outlet. A girl named Susan refused to send my package claiming I had to fill my customs forms online which is a flat out lie. I have a Canada Post business account and I send items almost every day. She was wiping off counters and took a couple minutes to even serve me at all. Seemed to me she just didn't feel like doing her job. So I have a contact at Canada Post I call in situations like this and I'll be calling him first thing in the morning to get Susan straightened out on what her responsibilities are. In the meantime no more of my business is going to Shoppers Drug Mart and you can thank Susan for that.
,Ning Dai,5,I went to ship something really important so I found this post office with good score. This is the only post office in edmonton that people working there know what they are doing and being friendly.
,Screwyou Knope,1,"Canada post's fuel surcharges are downright criminal. $58 for shipping a 3lbs package is bad enough, but then to add $35 of surcharges to the total after telling me it's going to be ""58 plus tax"" is ludicrous."
,Ashna Jay,1,I paid for a bunch of big envelopes regular mail and the associate printed the shipping labels off and handed them to me to stick them on. I've never had that happen at any other location and I've mailed the same envelopes in much larger quantities - the person at the counter always takes the bunch and sticks the label on in the back later even if they had a huge line up. I also had a second transaction and had my hands full with doing that but they still shoved the packages all at me on the small counter. Didn't feel super great that I had to do their job for them and it delayed the rest of my errands.
,Allil L,1,Chris was very rude when we went to get a package. He told us it was sent wrong and was angry with us (we were the ones receiving it so I don't understand how this was our fault) he told us he'd get our packages this time but never again if it was sent like that. We understand that but he didn't need to be as rude as he was.
,BB girl,1,Sent my grandmother a simple package for Christmas. Not only did it take over 3 weeks but they delivered it to the pickup center. Delivered no card to my Nana's post box. Said it was ready for pickup when tracked.  She went. No card. I had to call track it down. Only to find out they delivered it with the wrong area code. No name. No box number. No phone number. When it's Cleary written correctly on my copy of the ticket/receipt. Have issues with Canada Post every year. I hate using them. Cost me alot to send aswell. Horrible service.
,Anna Smith,1,I would like to give 0 starts if possible. The attendant Marlene was so rude to me when I was there to pickup my mail. This is a huge black patch for a company like Canada post. The first level management should fire people like them right at the spot. Not recommending this store at all. Completely horrible customer service 🤮
,Mireille Ngabo,1,"The old lady who works at this post office she is way too slow and she is so rude with clients, every time I find her I don't get services until I come a day that she isn't working. She gives hard time to customers, that is not good,  she needs to understand customers reasons and situation need to be observed not only post rules but some times she need to read and activity listening to clients for the better service"
,hunter steel,1,"Absolutely by no means pay for express shipping with these half Witt’s, biggest waste of money cause somehow has taken almost four days for it to even get to a post office for pick up?? Biggest waste of money and a useless carrier service"
,Esther C,5,I come to this location weekly to drop off packages for our small business. Rachel always greets my sister and I with a big smile and she shows so much professionalism and optimism in her work. She is very fast and efficient and just a pleasure to talk to!
,Lylasmum Cvilla,5,"I’ve always gotten good service here.  The way I see it, if you’re nice and polite to them, it’s easy for them to be nice back to you.  This is a very busy post office.  I agree with another reviewer who said that sometimes the line gets so long because of customers showing up UNPREPARED.  And I’ve never seen any of the post office staff behave badly when these unprepared customers show up.  It’s a small space. Even if I don’t want to listen, the whole queue can hear the conversation at the counter. And I could hear the post office employees always being very patient with explaining options to these unprepared customers."
,Lloyd Zilinski,3,"You need to hit it it just right to avoid a lineup of three to five people which can take 10 minutes to get through.  Service is generally good, just that it's a small outlet inside a store so only has counter space and facility to serve one customer at a time."
,Henry Ma,5,Attention to detail and Customer Service are the name of the Game for Customer Service. Chris the Store manager follow thru with promises. The Pharmacy Team actually cares about clients. What more can you want .
,Dustin Gate,1,"This is by far the worst CP location in south Edmonton. Every single time any member of my household has gone there there, the service has been rude, there has been some ""new policy change"", or some ridiculous excuse to make thinks difficult. Canada Post needs to reeducate the staff working at this location or fire them, and soon. Just appalling."
,SUKHDEEP SINGH,1,"Canada Post is garbage. I sent my passport using express post but, they never sent my passport and they lost it. Beware of these scammers Guys. Use any other courier services."
,Cheryl P,1,"DO NOT USE THIS POST OFFICE!!!!!!!!!! I would give a zero if I could.
I mailed letters with a couple samples in sealed, privacy envelopes and every single one had a tear in the corner with the samples removed when they arrived to their destinations. Each client of mine messaged me to thank me but to also let me know that they didn't get the samples because a thief decided to rip all of them and take what was inside for themselves. Since every envelope had this same issue, I know it was from the staff at the Shoppers Drug Mart post office. Stealing and invading my privacy; completely unacceptable.
In addition, I have never received 'friendly' service at this post office. Staff members don't smile and don't provide good customer service."
,Sual Dolem,1,"Expectations for Canada Post are low but this one is somehow worse.  Missing packages/returned packages/Marking packages delivered when they haven't arrived.  Service is slow and poor, with only one or two exceptions.  Management is TERRIBLE and has been for years.  Avoid this post office, especially renting a PO Box."
,Karen Pérez Cruz,2,"I rarely have nice customer service interactions with this Canada Post office. It's unfortunate how underdeveloped Canada Post is compared to other carriers such as UPS.

I brought to their attention a complaint of the mailman not ringing the doorbell or checking if anybody was home, before creating a notice for pickup at their office. They informed me that it's not mandatory for them to do so, and acted as if I was overeating.

They simply handed me a piece of paper with their customer service number and that was that. Disappointed that they don't take complaints or recommendations more seriously."
,Samantha Fraser,1,The staff at this location were great and kind. Canada post in general is a joke when completing a change of address for a business. We have only had a headache and a run around and list of excuses when calling in with the issues. It's extremely sad that the support lines continuously put the blame on the Canada post service locations when it is in fact a system issue not a location issue.
,John Alexander Smith,1,"They are rude.
They tried to charge me for the tape to closed the package.
I'll never go back there again."
,clark schuster,5,"There is some great staff who get to know you by name treat you very well butt as anywhere else there's also the people that are just there to collect some money and have no interest in being of service to anybody. But I love the staff there that are worth knowing and get to know you really make you feel welcome and you over and above what is expected of them so congratulations to the good staff, and to the rest of the staff please be pleasant and do your job."
,Krystal Lim,5,"Best post office ever, with the nicest and most accomodating staff! They allowed children from my daycare, Next Level Child Care to go to the post office as a field trip. Ann and her staff organized and planned a fantastic tour for our students. It was interactive and very children friendly. Thank you from Next Level Child Care!"
,Ethan Workun,5,excellent service will definitely be coming back here to ship my packages!!
,Angela Limb,1,"Went here to use the Canada post office. It’s a gas station run down dump. The Canada post person wasn’t even wearing a uniform or any sorts. Was in a tshirt & sweats. Didn’t greet me, ask about my day nothing. Didn’t even make eye contact. Definitely not a place I’d recommend. I would drive the extra distance to a REAL Canada post."
,Kev P,5,"I had a good experience or just my luck. Came here Wednesday morning around 9am. Was the only one. Came here to pick up my package. The clerk was nice to me, no hassle and no wait time. Got my package and went on with my day."
,Lol Lulz,1,"Unbelievable. Sitting here for 20minutes. With about 5 other people. No attendant around. Gas bar guy says “he does this 5 times a day” Canada post, cuts door to door, goes on strike right before Christmas, and leaves post offices un attended.  I guess I'll have to fed ex or ups."
,bob smith,5,Amor was incredibly helpful and efficient! Even helped me fold a shirt since I was struggling
,A J,1,"Slow moving when busy. I didn't see a sense of urgency when I was waiting.

Minus one star for every 10 minutes waiting. (40+)

Worker and customer still arguing."
,Gre Spotify,1,"The store says any rude customer will not be tolerated, how ironic is that? Guess what? Your employee is Extremely RUDE!!! GET SOMEONE WHO CAN TALK THE RIGHT WAY!!! SHE SHOULD NOT WORK IN A CUSTOMER SERVICE INDUSTRY. SHE SHOULD START UP HER OWN COMPANY BECAUSE SHE SEEMS LIKE SHE KNOW IT ALL! Rubbish kind of attitude 🚮"
,Jessie Schlosser,1,"Extremely rude and lazy at this location- she told me that she didn't have my package and couldn't find in when I know for a fact I tracked it to this location, then she gave me attitude and told me it's at a location I already traveled to when I told her multiple time that they did not have it there"
,El P.H.,1,"First, I would like to say that I only really like coming here when the cashier named Guillian is working. She is amazing at her job and is very accomodating even if it gets busy. Unfortunately, I don't see here working a lot in the Post Office Department nowadays. I had a package I needed to send to my boyfriend over to Portugal, and since I didn't know when Guillian would be working, I decided to just take the risk and leave my package in care of another post office clerk. I was helped by the older black female cashier with long hair wearing glasses and behind her was a younger Filipino boy wearing glasses as well. The woman supposedly typed all of my and my boyfriend's necessary details and charged me $98.00 for expedited shipping. I did think it was higher compared to all the other ones I've shipped with Guillian, but out of desperation, I decided to just pay for it. When she printed the paper to paste onto the package, my name wasn't even typed on the sender portion, and my boyfriend's address was incomplete. Right when I was just about to compain about it, the lady just said they'll just follow the details I had written on the package itself. After constantly checking up on the package with the tracking provided, we noticed that the package was stuck in Portugal's customs for 6 days. At first we thought maybe it was just taking longer on their end, but when my boyfriend decided to call, we found out some of the details the lady entered were not right. Instead of typing my actual name, she put Rachel. I don't have any idea where she got that from because my name is not even any closer. Like I mentioned before, she didn't type the complete address of my boyfriend which really delayed the package. She even just typed 'Portuga' and missed door and floor number as well as postal code. My boyfriend also had to pay for customs when I clearly declared it with her that it's a gift. This has just been very stressful to deal with because of her LACK OF ATTENTION TO DETAIL. You can't just say 'they'll look at the details you wrote on the package' and not bother to type the details on the computer properly. She needs to think of a career change if she doesn't like this job very much and not offer a good customer service."
,Mohamed Tlass,1,"Disgusting service, Filipino lady with short hair, as others mentioned, is very moody and rude, they say accept Amex cards but set up the POs machine to refuse them, then when paying with prepaid card she says the limit is 20$ which is false and tried to wrongfully cancel my payment!
When arguing was physically threatened and screamed at.
She harrassed another client over their proof of address despite having ID, and was racist on the phone with someone saying “f*^%ng Arabs”
Should be fired and sued and merchant account terminated"
,Darlene Johnson - DeeJay,5,The representative at the desk was very efficient and  helpful! She didn't rush me to get to the next customer 😃
,Yvette Fuego,1,"Staff gave me a different parcel, I almost opened the box, I was expecting 3boxes and I know one supposed to be huge  and heavy, not light so I had to check. What a hassle! When I called them, the guy that helped me said “it happens”. There was no line when I went, it was  early in the morning and I believed he messed up because there were three parcels and staff didn’t double check if he had given me the right ones. The box was with me all those time while I was doing some errands, hopefully the owner didn’t go to the post yet and I’m curious of what reason they had given in case. I’m trying to wrap up my Christmas prep and have to go back there  but way later. 😩"
,Andrew Cavaliere,1,"Unfortunately through multiple visits I have not had a decent experience. I am required to pick up any packages and registered mail at this location. I am always presented with slow, and unhelpful service. No effort put into customer satisfaction by staff. Also the staff are misinformed and convey improper information to customers. Ultimately people's time is wasted waiting to get no service."
,Bashar Zidan,5,There stuff very nice
,Daisy Lee,1,I don’t have any good experience in this location. If I can only not put any star. So slow. Didn’t ask for any help with other co-workers to make the line quick. She doesn’t care. It takes forever.
,alee x,1,"Terrible service, always terrible service, not professional, cheap service, they do not have an answer to any post service related questions, they do not provide printing service as Canada post advertise on the website, they even do not provide tap, paper or any thing, cheap lowest quality service i ever had!!! Will file formal complain with Canada post regarding this location. Other locations provide everything that this location do not provide!!!!"
,Alan,1,Irresponsible staff caused damage to my parcel. Do not recommend this location.
,Tiana Yang,1,"Worst place.
Takes forever even when it’s not busy at all."
,Jane Zx,4,"They could certainly use more staff for the busy times. Sometimes there will end up being a huge line up and only one person on front service. Otherwise I always get help when I am unsure of something, redirected to a better product if I am picking out the wrong thing, and everyone is nice. I've been going here (this Shopper's location) for years."
,Nilanti SenGupta,1,"The Indian lady in the front is the most rude person I know. Seriously! At first she was rude to me when I went to pick up my parcel, that moment I didn’t say anything because I thought she might be exhausted by doing works but today she did the same behaviour with my mom. Why you guys put these people into work? They are here in customer care service and they can’t even give a smile to them!!!!!!!"
,Colby,3,"Really good service but it is often understaffed. The employees do their best and do a great job with the resources they have. You can’t fault them for having so few people. Yes, you do have to wait in line sometimes but it is not the end of the world. I do enjoy the convenient location as well but as with most everyone else, I just wish they could have another person on shift to help sometimes."
,wongi C,1,"I don't understand why there are people at the counter who look tired and don't want to work. Very very slow and rude and passing my things by pushing her feet. I've been in a bad mood here at the office many times, but today was the worst.

If Canada Post insists that it's okay to be rude because the clerk is old and female, I'll forget what happened today.

One more here, a few months ago, my wife went to pick up something in the evening with a delivery notice, but after 20 minutes, she just came out empty-handed. When I asked why she was empty-handed, the clerk said she was busy and didn't have time to take care of her parcel, so the clerk told her to just go. My wife was almost in tears..... I went into the office upset and tried to ask the clerk what was going on. When the office clerk saw that my wife showed up with me, she immediately took care of the delivery notice and picked up the package in the back room. I've had a few more bad experiences with them, but I'll stop for today. My conclusion is Canada Post is rude, slow and lazy."
,griffin quigley,1,Today I went to this Canada post location as it was the closest to me while doing a work visit. This was my first time dealing with this location. I and an frequent customer so I expected my transaction to be easy just like the others well Boy was I wrong. I waited 20 minutes for the post office clerk to finish a transaction for a single stamp to the US. When I got up I asked for all my items to be sent lettermail 13 to be exact. She created the oversized mail labels and I paid for the transaction. She then told me that I had to place the labels on the parcels and I told her that was her job to do. She argued back at me during this time and I just did it to ensure that my items had the correct label on them I then realized she charged me 2 extra labels and told me that if I wanted a refund that she would have to cancel my whole transaction. She was very rude and I shouldn’t be doing her job. I would not recommend this location and hope that the customer service gets a big improvement
,Viki LI,1,Worst delivery and pick up service ever. My item was sent to the wrong location and I had to pick it up by my own….
,Woo Choi,1,"I sent my parcel (suitcase) from this location to Ontario at July 23 by Monica. I felt the person is look tired and work loosley and vacantly. and the item is not available to track since August 5, and status shows the item is still in Halifax. Do they sent my parcel on right way?  I spent my time and effort to find my parcel and submit investigation tickets via CP for a month but CP closed the issue. it was suitcase contains over $400 values stuff. I lost my package with no reason."
,Mike _,1,"Extremely inexperienced staff. The lady with post office manager name tag unable to print labels and blamed it on customer. Offers no resolution at all.

Use Almon St location if you can."
,V. Philendra,5,"Had a false customs charge on a package from Korea and Haliey encouraged me to send it for a re-evaluation, helped me with the forms, and I was back in today after a month getting my package released for free (as it should be because the shipping was already paid for in Korea while sending). Thanks to Hailey I didn't lose $40+, she absolutely deserves a raise!"
,Syameena Pillai,5,Gone to this location numerous times to return and pick up packages. All the staff have been extremely friendly and helpful. It's well organized and fast-moving. No issues at this location. Would highly recommend!
,Maxine Rudy,5,"I have always found the staff at this post office to be helpful, courteous and efficient!"
,Joseph Brooks,5,"I had to check the hours on google before going and noticed all the negative reviews. I was surprised since Ive gone to this location numerous times and never noticed anything negative. All these negative reviews about someone named Scott and so I couldnt help but notice that it was exactly Scott who was working when I went in today. He was perfectly polite and helped me with what I needed. I even was unintentionally a bit annoying as a customer and he still helped me with no rudeness or anything. I guess if you expect the red carpet laid out for you and a shoulder massage at the post office, and Scott doesnt do that for you, then you're bound to get upset and leave a negative review. But yeah there is really nothing to complain about at this place."
,Kenneth Carmichael,4,Decent little Post Office in the south end. This location has extended hours including on Sunday so it is more convenient than others. I’ve never had to wait long in the line up here as the staff seem to know what they are doing. They have a small collection of collectible stamps and First Day Covers as well. Many of these kiosks do not.
,Alisha Vidito,1,"Usually an okay post office location.  However, a few months ago, there was someone by the name of Stephanie working.  She was quite snippy and rude to me.  I asked her approximate times for different shipping options and she was abrupt/snippy: ""I have no idea! We can't predict anything"". An appropriate response could have been:  ""we are experiencing trouble with estimating times for deliveries because of xyz factors. Sorry about that, I wish I could be more accurate for you"".  Stephanie needs to improve her customer service! I left there extremely irritated and I will no longer recommend this location."
,Ting Li,1,"On Google and their location both show working hours until 2100(9pm), but I went the post office 6pm, they already closed. They should update the working hours properly."
,Bonnie Chiasson,1,"I know there are challenges in the delivery services and one has to allow a bit of delay for that under the circumstances.
However, knowing that your parcel from AMAZON has been sitting idle at this Halifax Central Station for 5, 6, 10 days is infuriating and frustrating. AMAZON has already refunded the value of two packages to me because of LATE DELIVERY!!! One package was valued at $69.19 and the other was $46.77.
How can this possibly happen?  Other delivery services have adapted to the current COVID-19 workplace changes. This has been going on for over a year after all. You should have adapted more effectively by now or you should just throw in the towel.
Most other delivery services manage to get their packages delivered on time and, in most cases, a day or two early.
Not only is this Halifax Central Station costing AMAZON a LOT of money, they are also a huge blemish for Canada Post.
Currently I am waiting for a package that has been in Halifax since March 23rd...it is now March 28th.  Their tracking site says it Now is rescheduled to arrive on March 30th.....it was due March 25th. AMAZON just sent me a message advising that I qualify for a refund due to late delivery.....AGAIN !!!!!
CAN ANYONE TELL ME WHY THIS IS HAPPENING OVER AND OVER AGAIN!!!!
Get your business in order HALIFAX!!"
,R E,5,"Note it's closed 24-26 Dec, 31 Dec- 1 Jan. This is the ONLY Shopper's with a photo lab for passports and official documents etc, as well as a post office. They're both inside the Shopper's but know that Canada Post had different hours."
,michele smith,1,They are supposed to be open till 9pm today. I needed 3 stamps had to buy a book of 10 because the postal outlet was closed.
,Grace Cowan,1,"Instead of updating their hours online like a professional business, they put up a sign, so I walked all the way to this post office to discover that they were closed. This was New Years Eve (a Friday), so I get that they’re also closed on New Years Day (Saturday), but I was informed that they’re also closed on Sundays, which is incredibly frustrating. Not only does this mean that I can’t pick up my package for 3 extra days, but I needed something out of the package for someone that was supposed to be leaving on the Sunday, and now can’t leave because we were unable to pick up the package. The front clerk that I called afterward to ask if there was really no way I could just pick up my package was unpleasant and unhelpful, all she said was that they would be open on Monday. Waste of my time and my friends money, because now they have to reschedule their entire transportation situation. And I could have collected it yesterday had they updated their information online and not given the impression that they would be open. Not impressed."
,S B (Strongbeans),1,"Needs to update their hours online.
Also their signs in store are also confusing for hours of business"
,John Knowles,1,"Girlfriend was overcharged, by 10+ dollars, and they weren't able to refund her for like 30 minutes. If you value your time, avoid this post office at all costs."
,MJ Seager,5,The ladies who work here always go above and beyond. Service with a smile and extremely understanding. I was very late to pick up a parcel and it was held there for me beyond my given days. I appreciate them! Thank you!
,Koustav Pain,5,"Been there twice, great experience both times. Really helpful"
,M Dambergs,1,"Closed at 6 due to COVID-19. Why aren’t the hours updated? I assume because the Lawton’s staff prefer to harass people who come by after 6 and are confused and upset, as they did to me when they prevented me from picking up a package that contained my medication.

If you don’t like having people call the cops on you for crying, don’t use this location."
,Asif Zarin,5,"I was assisted by Kimberly martin.
Very helpful and friendly lady.
She guide me very professional way."
,J Mac,5,"Angela is the best in the business. Always a pleasure to deal with, very professional and extremely helpful. Thanks for everything Angela, you are the main reason I do business with this Canada Post location!"
,Juliano Ferrari,1,"This is NOT directed to this location by any means but to the whole Canada post failing corporate. Since the last strike you had your service became terrible, I ran my business for decades by sending cheque’s via Mail. Now it’s 3 to 1 every three times they get it out once to desired destination. It’s effecting my reputation as a business owner.
Shame on you. Get enough man power out there or simply shut the operating Down."
,L. Y.,5,"Angela is her name and she is an angel
Saturday afternoon, She went beyond and above her way to help me reorganize the boxes, seal them back tight and ship them.
Thank you Angela, Canada post should be proud of having someone like you working with them. Kudos"
,taylor perry,5,"This is my regular post office and despite bringing 50-100+ packages there every time, the two main ladies are the sweetest and nicest people! They scan all my packages very quickly and i’ve never felt like they were irritated or annoying about having to do it!(like other locations ive been too). They’re so nice and make conversation about my business and i enjoy chatting with them while I wait! I remind them how awesome they are everytime! Thank you for your hard work everyday!!!🥰"
,Frank Wormald,3,Slow service. It's often busy with one clerk so allow 10-15 min.
,Shaul Byunghyun Go,5,kind and helpful staff. happy every time I drop by.
,Ayodeji Arowolo,5,"A lady served me today February 10, 2021 about 15:00hours and I must say that was excellent customer service! She was very helpful and polite and if I were a mystery shopper she'd score a straight 100%😃. Thank you very much."
,Rmie Rxs,5,"I came to post two parcels the other one international, I did not realize for the customs document, they do not really give you the paper form option anymore, instead it has to be done on line, anywho, not that I am making an excuse I am really busy with my chore, two children, work and other duties that I am always running, at Bayers Road Canada Post a year ago the staff at Canada Post gave me a $**t with this exact issue, I forgot to do the thing online, and I only have 10 minutes of window that day as I needed to return to my work,  Edie on the other hand (of Canada Post Larrry Uteck, 15th of October, approximately 1530) despite the line up, and because for some reason the scan won't work I kind of expected she would snap to me and judge me why I did not or was not able to do this on line, instead she said let me try to do it here manually for you, Edie thank you, you made my day, again I was on a hurry that Friday afternoon, and have not eaten anything and have to ran chores, but you took and help me accomplish one of my errands which is to finally send of these parcels, thank you for your kindness, patience we need more of this kindness especially these trying times"
,Ms. B,5,"Everytime I go into here the ladies are so nice. Always helpful. I mailed a parcel the other day on Saturday, we had a hard time with the process but the lady was very patient with me as was I with her. We finally got the job done. Great experience!"
,Manpreet K,1,"RUDE STAFF I never had an issue there before but this time it but kind of racist behaviour i felt there...
I was there on Feb 17 around 6:30-7:00 that CSR I know she is new there as i am regular customer but she doesn’t know how to talk and respond to customers..NO CUSTOMER SERVICE AT ALL... It was not only me that felt that but there was another girl as well she felt same way.. she only talk nicely if you are blonde breaks my heart. (She asked me to bring my lease paper as my NS license is not enough)
I will never go back to that location ever again
Used to be my favourite one"
,Carla Wright,5,"Amazing service from these ladies every time i go in there.  Always friendly and helpful.  Cannot say enough about these gems...  I take all my postal needs to them.  Julie, Pam and Colleen are awesome."
,Mervat Ahmad,1,"very rude Woman, her name's Colleen , she shouldn't be working in customer service she treat the people like garbage and she doesn't respect any of the people who were on line ,,,, i shouldn't put any star to this review"
,MALEK BADOUR,1,"The lady who works there ,her name is colleen and she's  very rude an she shouldn't be working there  very very bad customer service and bad attitude"
,Grant的加拿大笔记,1,"I took rerun label. The staff didn’t want to do anything about the package, just asked me to use the tape to seal envelope and put the label sticker on it. Thanks for training me! Maybe that’s their policy to teach customer how to self service?uh…or they don’t want to take any responsibility about packing if there’s something wrong with broken item, so they just want you to do everything and they just accept it what it is and deliver. It’s interesting service"
,Antony Fu,5,"Always like to come to this CP since moved to nearby community. Less busy than the one at Lacewood. The staffs here always have smile on their faces and always, always very patient.

I happen to be greeted by Kevin many times for afternoon visits. He is particularly informative and efficient, guiding me to the right type of service I need and save my time and money!"
,Corey Saunders,3,"Been my local post office for a couple of years now, and it's generally a normal post office experience. However, I went there yesterday evening to pick up and also send a package. I merely asked a pretty basic, nonchalant question (address/identification related) about another shipping service and the young woman curtly replied ""I don't know, I don't work for them."" Thanks, I knew that. After signing for my package on the touchscreen I forgot to press 'OK' and tried to press it with my finger and she basically yelled at me to use the pen. She might be the most unpleasant person I've dealt with as a customer in years. I know it's a government job and customer relations isn't priority one but she was just outright rude."
,Ghost Buster,1,"They won’t even print labels for returns. I had to go staples and spend $2-$3 trying to print the labels. I couldn’t get the labels to print. So I had to cancel the cancelation and send through ups. CP you give terrible service. Your packages take weeks to arrive, where every other courier service takes 2-3 days. Spent a couple of hours just trying to process returns."
,Nate Sutton,4,Store is located at the back of the Guardian. Staff have always been friendly and helpful. The biggest problem is there is only one person manning it that ive seen. This place can sometimes get busy and ive been stood waiting for 30 minutes + before. Other than that good.
,Anna Brozek,4,"Good service most of the time!!! I drop off packages every few days and most of the staff are really nice and always get to work scanning my parcels right away. There's just an employee or two that I have to ask for service. But overall really nice place. They have a bunch of supplies for packaging there too, if you're short on time. Just a tip though, you can find boxes for about half the price at a dollar store! Same with the bubble mailers."
,Nigel Thorpe,5,Situated in Shoppers Drug Mart. Friendly staff.
,Johnny Chronic,5,Friendly staff :)
,Scarlet Dean-Moore,5,
,Fran A,1,"Please stay out of this Canadapost as they are ridiculous! I came here with my return package and they rejected it as it’s too complicated for them or someone is too lazy to try to help or figure it out.

I had 3 items from the same shipper on Amazon. On the label it said 3! Items but they gave ridiculous excuse… oh you need 2 other different labels.  And I’m like they all came together.
Going back and forth just for one of them to tell her colleague “oh manager said we shouldn’t accept these items”.

And I’m just like you guys should have just said you’re too lazy to return my items than giving me silly excuses!"
,Ev McCrea,5,Stephanie is the best she helped me out with everything from stamps to packages she is the best. I just want to say this because this post office seem really under rated.
,Reggie Sutton,5,Maria was very kind and helpful!
,Meizheng Tong,5,The lady is kind and extremely helpful 😊
,canchooc,1,"Lucky if they even go in your driveway before listing the package as ""attempted to deliver"""
,Graeme Lipford,1,"Went through 3 employees - nobody knows what Snap Ship is? I’ve been shipping here twice a week since dec 2019, take 2 months off of shipping and now suddenly nobody working there knows how to scan a QR code and print a shipping label- saying they’ve never heard of snap ship.

Like going to McDonald’s and being told sorry sir, we don’t know what French fries are, are you sure you’ve ordered them here before?

Ridiculous"
,Monique MacKenzie,5,I had excellent service last night. The young man was very efficient. He had a pile of parcels to tend to but was very patient with me.
,Michelle Dyke,3,"Had a bit of a wait, not too long."
,Manpreet K,5,They have best staff as compared to any other location of Canada post 👍🏻 I feel confident and always come back with smile just because of their great customer service
,shirley haynes,5,Always good service
,Tom Cao,1,"They don't even provide tape, you need to buy it yourself"
,Dan Nordoff,4,I've always had great customer service here.  Pleasant staff and professional service. It can be busy sometimes though because of its central location.
,Ryan O'Toole,1,"Rhonda is the absolute rudest person I've dealt with in a long time. Every time, too, without fail."
,Corey Grandy,3,Supervisor could use a lesson in customer service and being a pleasant person from her much nicer employees.
,Qasem,1,Different than other Canada Post locations! It seems like it's privately run. Workers are usually slow and inefficient. They charge higher taxes on mail than other locations!
,Jason,5,"Attention: this post office is not open to the General Public, it in located inside CFB Halifax and requires a Department National Defense (DND) Identification Card to access this part of the base.

,Joe Cheng (joeFNcheng),5,
,K,1,
,Jason Smith,1,Item was delivered to my house but I had to sign for it. When I went to sign for it the driver said he made a mistake and I would have to go to the post office after 6pm and pick it up there. He literally took the package back from my hands.  I drove to the post office for 7pm (it closes at 8pm) only to be told by Superstore staff that they are understaffed and needed to pull people from the Post Office to man the Superstore.
,R K,1,"Only gave it one star because zero was not an option. The people here used to be half nice, but the woman behind the counter now is the most rude and sarcastic publicly-funded loafer I've ever dealt with. Repeated mistakes on my packages were backed up with arrogant defiance about how ""hard-working"" CP staff were, which is not terribly evident in the cow-gazing-over-a-fence performance in this location. I now drive the extra distance to go to a real Post Office."
,Simon Gagne,3,"I normally don't have any bad comment about this location, but today, the employee deserved a 0.01 star. She was so angry that i didn't have a postal code on my package. I was scare she would jump over the counter in rage and use her tape gun to put me in a box an return me to sender."
,Ashlan Potts,4,"We love how convenient this location is, as we can drop off mail or pickup postage whenever we do our groceries. We've never had an issue with the opening hours, but we are also nearly always there at the same time. They have plenty of packaging and postage options, packing supplies, gifts and memorabilia, as well as a national and international mailbox on site. The staff is usually always excellent, although our favourite person seems to have left. My only suggestion is to have more staff on during busy times. I know they have more to do than just accepting mail, but sometimes if they don't see you at the front it can be challenging to get their attention."
,Richard Martin,2,"Today I was left a key for one of the compartments for packages.  When I open it there was nothing in it.  I am sure it was in the other compartment because it would have been to large to fit in the one he left me the key for.  Everyone can make a mistake, but two weeks age I got the key for another package.  When I open the compartment it was for someone else.  A neighbor down the road stop by because the postman had left her a key for the my package.  The I he left the key for me to open was for her neighbor who didn't get any key.  I don't think this is just a mistake, it's being careless in you job."
,Travis Whalen,5,"The staff was nice enough. There is no outdoor signing showing where this post office is so if you don't normally live around here or shop at the Atlantic Superstore, it can be tough to find. I found it after feeling lost for a little bit.

Long story short it's in the Atlantic Superstore near the NSLC and directly down the area to the left when you walk in the doors. Near the cash registers."
,Lisa Butt,5,I had the privilege of using this facility for 10 months for my business needs. Staff was always very professional and helpful. Thank you kindly from Lisa at Oceanview Quilt.

,Alireza Siadat,5,Super friendly and caring staff. Have used this place three times and never got disappointed! They guide you very well. I’ve been getting good service here so far.
,J M,1,"Postman never attempts delivery (a frustration in itself), so I have to deal with the very rude man that works the counter. One time there was a woman working in his place and she was so much friendlier. The one star is for her."
,Alexander Howlett,1,"Got in line before they closed, but said that by the time they were done with what they were doing they would be closed and wouldn't be able to help me or the other person in line. Absolutely ridiculous"
,Darshi Patel,1,"I had a very bad experience with this location.
They mentioned the closing time 7:00PM. Thought I went there on 6:50PM and they said they can’t take my parcel and the store is closing 15mins early every day. So if you’re closing at 6:45PM you guys need to update the time on google."
,Sidney Hamilton,1,"This is nothing against this specific Canada Post. Just Canada Post in general. They are terrible and can never manage to deliver a parcel on time. How can some random person in a rundown mini van or sedan manage to deliver packages faster and in better condition than our national mail service with unionized workers? Also how is this company still allowed to sell priority and express post when they can't even guarantee what time it will get there? If a private company did this, it would be considered fraud."
,Justin Laing,1,"Canada post website, as well as Google, clearly state this location is open until 7pm. I showed up at 6:47pm and after standing at the counter for 5 mins, the worker, who saw me standing there for the 5 mins, said the location closes at 6:45pm. Umm, no, it doesn't as that's not posted anywhere. I wasted my time and gas driving there for nothing. This location needs all new employees."
,Brooklyn Aldo,1,"Google says open until 6:00pm on sunday, i’m here at 5:28pm and all the doors are locked."
,T K,1,Internet says open till 6 on Sunday.  I am here now at 5:25 and it is closed????
,Amanda Chiong,4,"I'm moving and shipped quite a few fairly large boxes through CanadaPost at this location. The person who helped me at the counter was perfectly fine, and the process went smoothly. They let me borrow a cart to bring the boxes inside as well. I did notice that the other person working and helping the other customers seemed to be a little less polite, but not so much that it was offputting."
,Maxwell Veer,1,"Is the requirement for working here to be extremely rude for no apparent reason? Imagine being a mailman and also being condescending, hilarious"
,Kendra Gorveatt,5,"I just sent Christmas gifts home to Ontario. Steve was extremely efficient and kind, assuring me that the parcel would be there in four business days.  I have had some bad experiences with FedEx and UPS and it is so nice to go to a Canada Post office and get good customer service and the assurance that your parcel will be handled with care. This location also has a great social distance policy of only three in the store at a time, and you can wait outside until it is your turn to go in."
,slade,1,Worst sourting facility for all canada post in all of Canada and they know it and could care less.
,Dave D,1,"When my  $3000 parcel tracking says it out for delivery by end of day on Thursday, then when it doesn't turn up and I check the tracking again on Friday and it says "" due for delivery on Tuesday"" you get one star because I can't give you none, Muppets."
,janet crozier,5,The staff at this location are always very friendly and efficient. They are also very knowledgeable regarding systems and protocols. There is rarely any wait time at this location.

,Joe Blackmore,2,
,Todd Weber,1,"I went in to return a modem to our ISP using a return Id + auth number and the manager in training behind the counter looked at her screen for 30 seconds and asked if we had a barcode, when we said no she said “It only asks me for a bar code, sorry thats the best I c an do” and told us to come back at 1pm when someone else would be there. Went down the road to the Canada Post on Sackville drive and the young gentleman there had our package processed in under a minute when given the exact same information."

,Brett Matthew,1,"There’s a woman with glasses, dark hair, and hand sanitizer around her neck who has no customer service skills.

I’ve worked for shoppers for over 8 years. Both times I have went she has had an attitude. She one time asked me rudely to put my package on a scale like I should know to reach over the counter and do that. I’m not a mind reader all you have to do is ask nicely. I don’t know if she is on the spectrum or just doesn’t know how to talk to people but she needs to figure it out or do something where she doesn’t talk to people."
,Elisa Raymundo,1,"I have a package from Service Canada for my renewal passport for pick up at this Shopper location , Julietta  (staff)asked me my ID I gave her my Canadian Citizen Card with picture She told me that it is not acceptable as per Canada Post Policy She didn’t even asked me nicely if I have another documents with my address on.  It was frustrating the way she said this is the first time I have experienced. She was refusing to give me my package. I don’t drive so that’s the only photo ID that I have. The package she was refusing to give me had my only other photo ID which is my passport so I had to suggest to her to give me my package to show her it’s my renewal passport.. Very very RUDE customer service. She should familiarize the acceptable government issued ID … of course it is understandable that some ID like passport don’t have address on , she can ask another form of ID with address that I can provide her instead of rejecting my Canadian Citizenship Card."
,Brittany Medeiros,5,"Julietta at the canada post counter on leila was absolutely fabulous. Came in for a money order and our couple minute chat really got me through a tough time. Wonderful customer service skills, cannot wait to come in again:) thank you for helping me this evening."
,Nah Fam,1,"Very rude workers, avoid this location at all costs. Drive 5 minutes down mcphillips to the location on mountain, they know what good customer service is. All the staff who work there are super friendly!! Unfortunately I don’t have much of a choice when most of my mail gets delivered to this location but when I do ship out mail/packages I always go to another location. A white lady with brown short hair who wears glasses (from the looks of it, seems like a lot of the the reviews from other people posted on here know exactly who I’m talking about) talks DOWN on people of colour… racist much? Maybe if I was white perhaps I would have different experiences with her haha. Always has a bad attitude, whenever you ask her a question it seems like she rather be elsewhere, acting like your a inconvenience to her and gives a snarky reply..… why work in customer service when you have none lol… this is coming from someone who works with the public as well. I get having a bad day but every single encounter I’ve had with this lady she’s been nothing but miserable to deal with, don’t take it out on customers… absolutely ridiculous…"
,MM PP,1,"By far the WORST customer service I have ever experienced. They tell customers they're too busy to retrieve their packages and don't answer the phones or respond to multiple voicemails. If I had a business I would never use Canada Post, as their delivery service is despicable and unreliable and only seems to have gotten worse in the paste few years. I'd give a minus star score if I could."
,Logan Granger,1,The old lady here has an attitude for some reason basically interrogated me about what I was trying to send and and told me it was impossible to send when It actually is possible and I just had to buy the label online but she didn't know that or just opted to not mention it
,Tara Anderson,1,"If you can please avoid this location if you’re going to have your packages sent here, the costumer service here is terrible, their is a guy with glasses and medium long hair that works here and if you don’t have what he needs or don’t answer the questions his asks right he will literally act like a child and roll his eyes at you and start being rude even if you’re polite and respectful.  Avoid at all costs, you have been warned. Their are previous complaints of this worker too. So if you want good costumer service  please have your packages sent somewhere else."
,Samantha Galvin,1,"Line is always long. Your delivery notice says a time you go there at that time and they tell u come back tomorrow because parcels havent been through the system. Needs better communication between delivery drivers and stores. Make sure people get packages when told.
Delivery drivers in general are the worst, they knock one time so quite u barley hear it. And gone within 30 seconds. I've herd the knock tried to get my robe on when I got to the door they were pulling away.
Any elderly person would never make it to the door that quick. Maybe try wait a few minutes ? Like really."
,fulltime fishing,1,the guy that works the evening shift is horrible at customer service. I have had 3 packages to be picked up here all 3 times the same guy that works evenings with glasses and medium length hair told me my package werent there. the first 2 times I asked if he could look in the back maybe it hasn't been processed. he goes and finds my package. then today the third time I've been here. he threw a hissy fit and you could hear him tossing boxes an yelling. with out a doubt thee worst Canada post experience I've ever had actually the top 3 worst Canada post experiences were here. it's always issues here. would not reccomend to anyone. I only go here because Canada post takes my mail here. STAY AWAY IF YOU CAN!
,Mike Kozubski,1,"One of the worse trackers in use as it doesn't actually track the package...will just keep changing the date when it says by the end of today.

Don't you know when it leaves the building on a truck? You knew when you picked it up..from there I should know when it reaches Canada Post, then when it's done processing and then when it is leaving to be sent to me...and finally a delivery notice saying the package has arrived and to check my box.

Canada Post doesn't do any of that with their tracking, yet a Chinese website selling me little dolls for my daughter does."
,JACK SUN,1,"I would give zero star if there is an option. There was an Asian fellow wearing glasses who works at this location was extremely rude and unprofessional. I ordered the parcel from Amazon for pickup, and Amazon had to change the shipping address to that store address in order to ship there for me to pick it up. And the Asian fellow who works there argued with me that my driver license address didn’t match with the Amazon label shipping address and advised me to contact Amazon to fix the shipping address on the label. And I told him in order for me to come this location for pickup, the shipping address has to be the store address otherwise Amazon would just ship it to my house instead. And he tried to argue with me that the name, address has to be matched as per their policy and told me in the future if the address didn’t match, he will refuse to release the products. Also pointed fingers and raised his voice at me, saying I got “Spoiled” in the past few years came to this location for pickup. Totally unprofessional and rude to the customer. Later on regarding this matter, I did contact Amazon carrier centre and the lady advised me that as long as I have the bar code from Amazon and name, Canada Post should release the products cause there is no way Amazon can change the shipping address to my residential address otherwise the parcel will not be landed at the Canada post location. She also advised me that if this happens again, I can pass the call to the local Canada post for the further procedure.

Anyway, the total experience was extremely rude and unprofessional. If you need any services from them, try to go different branches to get better customer experience."
,Pinterest User,5,Awesome staff!!! They are super helpful and knowledgeable.  Yesterday I witnessed a customer being outright rude about a parcel sent by Amazon and the male staff wearing glasses handled it like a pro and provided excellent customer service.  I hope that the Amazon shopper who was complaining and could not identify himself based on the shopper's mailing address reads this review and realizes just how ridiculous and ill-mannered he sounded when speaking.  He was embarrassing himself.
,Shawn Johannesson,1,"Lady behind the counter was rude and unhelpful. I was alerted that a package was ready for pick up at this location. She refused to even look for the package and told me it wouldn’t be there until the next day. She swore at me under her breath as I was leaving. I phoned in and lodged a complaint. I returned an hour later, after she had gone home, and had no issues getting my parcel. I found out that her name is Carly and she isn’t very well liked by her coworkers or customers."
,Rachelle Thompson,1,"They have the worst customer service! The first time I went there, the lady acted as if I was bothering her whenever I asked her anything. This was my first time ever mailing anything and I just needed some guidance. The cashier there didn't care and because of that the envelope that I gave them was mailed to my neighborhoods mail box instead of Calgary. I had to go back to the branch to have it mailed again and paid $18.95 for express shipping. This lady wasn't friendly either but she guided me. I also paid $2.04 for the first time just for it to be mailed to my mail box.

What is also ironic, she treated the white persons with so much respect but myself being black was ignored and my mail that was suppose to be delivered was late for the deadline.

Will never go back to that branch!"
,Kirsten Constant,1,"rude customer service. went in there to drop off mail. lady behind the counter was rude and didn’t offer any helpful suggestions when i apparently did something wrong regarding my package. she told me to “try anyways” and then proceeded to just label my parcel ‘return to sender’.
I wouldn’t waste my time going here if they aren’t going to be helpful if you have questions.
not sure who benefits with that type of attitude lol."
,LI Yan,1,Today is Saturday. I followed the time on the notice they leave on my door. I arrived at 4:03. They told me already closed. I checked the notice again. Why they don't change the time? And Sunday closed. I have to wait until Monday. Waste time!
,I K (Kira),5,They do money gram here. Good to know as when I needed it I couldn’t find it anywhere.
,Priyansh Shah,5,Quick customer service and kindly staff
,Rubean E Sam,5,The staff (Rina) was very knowledgeable and helpful. Very friendly. This was my first visit to Canada post and I am very much impressed from the overall experience I had today. Rina helped me select the right packaging and took time to explain the mailing process and even helped me pack the product properly. Thank you very much for the excellent service.
,Sheila Lapinski Smith,5,"Very friendly, helpful staff :)"
,Ben Dover,5,I got stuck inside. Thankfully there was a homeless guy in there to keep me company
,Canadian Mulhid,1,Google says they r open till 9 however just went in and they said they closed at 4:30 today
,Eric Manzanares,1,"It’s crazy nobody is here but the office is open. There are a message « I will be there  in one hour », really??"
,Canadian Info,5,They are getting better friendlier packages are coming undamaged becoming a trusted carrier of mine now thank you to the men an women of Canada post I appreciate you more than you know I'm this time.  I hope you stay well friends.
,Ken K (kenterprize),4,"Well I think this might be a first 4 star review for a canada post from me.
The ones in my rural area dont compare to here.
Customer service great and they actually have answers to any mail questions you have.
The location is busy and seems like any time I come theres always a line up."
,Pissy Krissy,1,"There is never anyone there whenever I go. 2:15pm, 5:30pm always away for lunch or break, no staff to cover so you are forced to stand in an ever growing line until the staff return. They should have staff to cover breaks."
,Aadi Rafi,1,"The brown lady at the post office is rude whenever I get my package she's always frowning, giving me a stare that she doesn't like her job and her tone of voice when talking to me is very very rude. The other staffs are really nice, please remove her in the front if she doesn't like to do customer service. I still say thank you and she doesn't even show any signs of politeness 😔"
,Meghan Scarff,5,Whenever I go to this post office I always hope Alex is working- he is very pleasant and helpful! He goes above and beyond and is very patient when I have lots of packages to mail!
,anshika anshika,1,The indian lady at front is extremely rude!!! i had to return stuff and she started arguing with me for no reason. also she rolled her eyes at me. i myself work in customer service. i havent seen such a rude customer repersentative ever!!!! for real
,CAROLINE,1,"I came here on Saturday and I had some extremely important documents that needed to get to Edmonton , I was gaurenteed that they would be there Tuesday during business hours and they haven't left Winnipeg, completely unacceptable. And this company is doing nothing. False advertising, and a failure to do the job that I paid them to do. DO NOT USE THIS SERVICE."
,Roxanne R,5,"Jason (the post office manager) was super helpful and friendly!

Really appreciate his help today! His determination and problem solving skills are amazing. Thank you again, Jason!"
,B. M.,5,"Best run Canada post location in the city, hands down!  The gentlemen who works here fulltime Monday-Friday knows his stuff.  I always tell people to visit him if they are unsure about pricing or the best way to send something.  He wont lead you wrong.  He also trains all the new staff on how to work the system and send packages in the correct way.
This location also gets the most pick ups of any other postal outlet in the area.  If you need your package to move quickly, bring it here,"
,Hayden C,5,Pretty decent great service.
,Kim,5,Friendly service when I needed to ship some parcels.
,Yasser Solo,5,Great stuff
,Simran Kharoud,1,"Extremely poor customer service skills with zero knowledge about the parcel services. The lady ( ketali) working there was extremely rude, impatient and don’t even know to behave with customer. I wish if manager can see her performance that will improve the canada post services"
,Stephanie S,1,"I usually don’t write reviews but sadly this is the second time I have received extremely poor customer service from one particular employee that works here.

I recently went to try to return a package and had printed off a label for return. This label however was not something I recognized so I thought the Canada post office might help. This was the first time I had ever returned an item by mail so so wasn’t sure exactly what to do.

Before I could even explain the situation to the nice employee helping me, the woman cut us both off mid sentence telling me “Yeah you can’t drop that off here. Don’t ask me where you need to take it. Google it on your own.”

It was an extremely rude encounter that made me feel very belittled. Clearly based on others reviews I am not alone here.

Not sure if she’s over worked or like this on a regular basis but I will not be revisiting this location any time soon."
,Leigh C.,3,"Unbelievable Anita still works there. Everyone else is friendly, helpful and patient, so it's only fair I give 3 stars. But if you get this lady she will not take the time to answer questions and undermines what you already know. I had a Christmas parcel I was only able to mail out the first week of December to U.K. (I've done it the December before with no trouble and it only took a week to arrive there.) I'm aware of the deadline that ensures it gets there before Christmas. I'm aware of when Royal Mail stops it's service for the holiday. But I was having some confusion with the online customs form and needed help, as well as how to make sure everything is packed up right. I heard a crack when she was ""helping"" place things right. Anita pushed me off to the side and said she'll take other customers while I figure it out. I had other questions but she ignored me and I had to wait in line, again. This happened at least 2 more times. When I got everything on the customs form filled I showed the box code but the scanner wasn't reading it off my phone. She demanded I make my screen brighter which was at max, and told me to put the box code in the center in which it didn't move. She was grabbing my phone, putting her fingers on the screen. She somehow flipped to the next page and then when I flipped it back all the information was erased. She made me go off to the side, no apologies, and reenter everything on the form. I protested as I was already there for over an hour. She then told me I could fill out the paper form. I asked for that in the first place. She made a big deal in me asking for basic airmail because of the deadline. I had already told the recipients it might get there late, so no biggie. Anita slapped the holiday mailing schedule on the counter. When I told her standard air again she rudely piped ""Well, you should've mailed it earlier."" After all that fuss the parcel had made it out there in a week. Turns out the glass in the frame was broken. Thanks Anita.
The last time I had gotten her was to get a money order for rent. I told her the name of the company and to put the number in the company's name in roman numerals. She said she can't do that they don't have roman numerals. This was the most pathetic excuse to not want to do a job proper. All she had to do was put II and she still refused. She said if I want roman numerals to go to the bank and get a bank order or something like that or go along with her 2. I agreed and then she printed off the money order before letting me check everything was right on the screen. I haven't heard word from mgmt that anything went wrong, but I do not trust her ""knowledge"" and I think I'll just use the post office at 7/11 from now on. (Sorry that was long. The first one really made an exciting day into a stressful day because of that lady's attitude.)"
,Marissa McDougall,1,This review is specifically about Anita. This lady is clearly not fit for a customer service based job. I was already having a bad enough day and she did not fail to treat me like a little kid. The best part is that I know a handful of people who experienced the same thing with her. Unbelievable. I will do business elsewhere next time.
,Myss Lyss,1,I avoid returning at any cost. I wish certain parcels could be directed to either the Reenders Sobeys location or the Concordia location. The girl with the mustache and brightly coloured hair acts Superior to customers. Gives you a hard time and attitude to boot. I don't know how some people have jobs in this city. People in customer service at this location seem to hate people and think we're all idiots...so go work somewhere else.
,Navjot Brar,1,"Today i visited at post canada, nearly 7 o clock evening time there was a lady she had no sense that how to deal with customer. She was showing me attitude, if you donot know about customer service donot do job. Even she was very rude totally bad service. This type of persons should not be on customer service who have no sense that how to deal with customer. To the lady, be in manners."
,Sheryl Chislett -Goddess Of Light,5,"The first experience I had having Canada post bring my beloved fave mail on a Sunday brought right to my new flat door  . I'm glad they caught up their backlog after the snowstorm . A giant thank you. As well ,the keewaitin location mostly always has nice service as well, so thanks."
,The Tweakjunkie,5,"Great service, great staff. I use CP exclusively now. No more UPS, as in, ""Oops"", we dropped your package."
,Money Jodhan,1,Close after opening time .... started work at 9:10 ..... and i see the timing online thats 8:30
,Sukhminder Boparai,1,Not a good service. Lost my equipments.
,Madison Gordon,1,Not sure why they even bothered buzzing my apartment if they weren’t going to bother bringing it to my door. Got a “delivery notice” when I buzzed them in. What a joke
,Sheena Marsden,1,"I pick up my mail at this location today and an employee didn’t accept my certificate of Indian status card? I even showed her my health card along with it, Indian status card is a government issued ID. She asked for my bank statement? Why? I had to show her my bank statement to pick my mail, I don’t know if she’s racist or what. Also, its says on the Canada post website that they accept status cards to pick up mail. She needs to be educated or fired."
,Yujiao Samantha Guo,1,"I am so disappointed with the service in this Canada Post. If you have any important mails or packages to deliver, never come to this one in the Sobeys. I have two unpleasant experience here. The first one is my husband mailed a document to USA, the staff there did not give us the correct amount of postage that we should pay. Our document was returned saying not enough postage. Then my husband spent over $40 to mail a premier one because it has to be delivered the next day.
On Oct 3, I went to the Canada Post to use an Xpress service and the package should be delivered today. Then I found out that the staff there input the wrong destination postal code. He put my home address into the destination. I can't believe it! What kind of mistake it is! I have a copy of mailing information and I am sure that I wrote down everything correctly. Then I called Canada Post inquiring about this matter. They said they may return the mail back to me or correct it by themselves.
I will never use the service in this location any more."
,Rita Nimchonok,5,"I am so grateful for the help and kindness.Ashley for always taking care of me in the post office.For anne who today was so wonderful and the gentleman I'm sorry i think name kyle.If it wasn't for the help and kindness of people like you.I would not be making it through the pandemic.

,kelvin schaan,5,great staff and great location but the area can also be pretty rough with all of the panhandlers but the staff here are always more than willing to help you get your mail or package delivered and the store is very well organized and it's rather easy to find what you want to buy
,Evil Dave of Canada (EDC),3,I get all my parcel shipments sent there so I'm usually going there about twice a month. I have found that the quality of service went down after these new workers started. Reduced from five(5) stars to three(3) and will be watching if their deserve to regain or lose more stars. The only worker from the previous staff now works the first shift right after opening.
,L B,1,"Do not trust this Canada Post. I sent a parcel back to a company through this location because it was nearby. I was suppose to get a tracking number and a receipt. But the guy working said no there won't be one. I had a bad feeling about the trustworthiness and ethical work of this Canada post worker. I asked him three times if he is sending it to the correct address I showed him. He said, ""yeah."" He didn't even let me see the box after he put a tag on it and walked away. I should have trusted my gut feeling and taken the parcel back. But I gave him the benefit of the doubt. My mistake!!! Now a lost return which means lost money."
,etelvina Demelo (vina),1,I always drop package there fine how the boxes same shipping goes tracking but the envelopes  disappears  have lost 2 of them but I know who is always when one person is working next time I will get her I'm going put dye on when she opens will be on her face her on act
,Jason Camu,1,Worst service. Went there to pick up money thru moneygram Sean the guy working there input a wrong email address and now I have to wait 10 days to fix that. I called moneygram to figure that out.

,Ven Laspina,1,"Horrible service!! I went there on Friday June 29th, 2018 to pick up my package.  They were ""suppose"" to be ""opened"" until 9, however there was a sign up stating that they were closed until Sunday July 1st...went there today July 1st and another freaking sign saying they were closed today! A rude woman that apparently works there says ""were closed"".  I said you were closed all weekend and there's a sign up stating this on Friday.
The woman was like no there wasn't (calling me a liar)....she was like I'm not going to argue with you..yeah because you know I'm right!! I have learned my lesson and I will never have a packaged ship there nor will I support this post office in the future!! Horrible service!!"
,Music Passion,1,"Sent a letter by Priority mail. Next day checked it out - the letter wasn't registered at all. Called canada post - was suggested to return and talk to office agent. Returned, was told to call them again and create a ticked. Called - created a ticked, hopefully, everything will be alright... Will never use canada post for sending the documents..."
,Shannon S,1,"I made a visit to the Grant Park location today. Not impressed! Surely you can train someone with some customer service skills. Also make sure they are fully aware of what services are offered as stated on the website. Train them to focus on their paying customer, not elsewhere. Maybe this is not the job for her!"
,Ravneet Sandhu,2,"They lady was not friendly at all, looked like she was training someone and clearly was frustrated because of that. The attitude was bad, rolling eyes and and sighing again and again. Made me feel i did something wrong by bringing the parcel there."
,Kimberly Jade,1,"I thought it was just me, but I went on here to read reviews and seems like Debra is going through it and projects the impression of hating her job. I understand people have their own personal issues, but not a reason to be rude, sarcastic and can't be bothered with a smile, especially at work. I relate to the one review on here where she says she was happy when she saw two other girls working there, it really is a breath of fresh air and positive experience not having to deal with Debra. I hope she finds healing and peace."
,I K (Kira),1,"It's been my home location for 10 years and the past two I would rather go out of my way and drive elsewhere than deal with Debbra. I don't understand why someone stays on the job if they hate it that much. And it was always like that at tis location. Always rude, treats clients like  if they are bothering her, gives wrong information about prices (how many times I took my parcel to another post office after getting a quote from this location and had other options given to me). Always negative experience and it's just tiring. I was so excited when they got 2 new girls at that location and they were sweet and friendly at the start too. Idk, maybe it's a post office job that kills joy in these employees or Debbra's attitude is contagious but they all now quite unfriendly there."
,A W,1,"The cashier is unbelievably stupid, I’m returning a pair of shoes, she just simply stuck the shipping label on the box lid? I was like????????? How are you gonna safely deliver the shoes back? I guess only the lid would be delivered. Such a smart cashier."

,A Harasym,1,"Untrained staff. Parcel was dropped there as I was not home. Two days still didn't show there. Called them twice every evening, said nothing they could do as it showed not there. Didn't even look. Called lady there during day and she found it, actually went and looked! Said they didn't enter it right. Not impressed as I wasted two days and opened a case with canada post to find it. Train your staff better! This is the second time they lost my parcels!"

,yitian gu,1,"Please note that if you want to send a box please choose the right box by yourself in the store, my friend asked the clerk three times and she only told me to choose the box by myself for the third time, what did you service? I think it is your job to help me choose the box because it is my first post office return, not to let me and my friend in your place constantly test the size of the box. Please bring tape, he doesn't provide any tape there if you need the proper way to reinforce it. You will need to buy additional tape in the store. The clerk is basically not empathetic, I am not too comfortable with rudeness to describe someone, I just think he is not serious about his job. And the clerk needs to repeat the queue to solve a problem, I stood in line three times yesterday, I hope you don't encounter such a bad experience as I did."

,Maura Stanhope,1,The shoppers employee working it was rude prissy. Irregardless of the fact I have been bedridden for months with a 6 cm bed soar n was in severe pain.  It took a lot for me to go there. It's not my fault they refuse to deliver mail to my 18 story apt block.  I showed my health card n picture I'd and she refused me.  The postal station on McDermott accepted those bids. She made my whole day angry n I'm usually happy n very outgoing when I get a chance to leave my bed.

The woman working the counter almost had a kitten when SHE had to type everything into the computer herself. Absolutely ridiculous behavior from a postal/ CUSTOMER SERVICE employee.

,Idowu Adedeji,5,Great service and very efficient personnel. Posted item took 3 days to arrive.
,Princess TP,1,"Today I went to this location with the intention of mailing a parcel with a postage paid slip that had been emailed to me.

Upon arrival I was greeted by Tomas. He was friendly enough until I showed him that the postage slip had been emailed to me. He said he was only able to use QR codes to print labels and he was unable to print a label from an email.

I explained to him that I had been at another location where they informed be that they were unable to use QR codes but I had to print my own label. However, after a little sorting they were able to print up a label and all was well. His response to this was “I don’t know how they were able to do that, I’ve worked here for 8yrs and it doesn’t work that way” I asked him if he could scan the barcode and see if there was anything he could do. He said “it won’t work”. I continue to explain that the other location was able to and I asked why there is such an inconsistency between the stores. He just continued to say it was not possible. I asked him if there was someone he could call to help guide him. He said “it would just be a waste of time”

He proceeded to tell me he had never even heard of the location I was talking about (which is the Family Foods on Portage @ Ferry Rd.) I let him know that they were an older location. He said “I didn’t think they had a post office there” I said “perhaps he needed more training” and left with un-mailed parcel.

As I was walking away I heard him loudly say don’t come back. There a long line of people.

I felt he did not have any interest in doing his job. I was NOT unreasonable, loud, vulgar, or belligerent. He just would NOT even try. I have never been treated so poorly as a customer and I will not be returning to this location."
,Alyssa Batt,1,If I could give this place a 0 I would. The lady wouldn't release my medication package to me because I forgot my license. She told me if I could show her my credit card statement along with the picture of my id I could have it. Then after I went through my banking (like she said I could) she still said no? Why make me show you my finances if you weren't going to give it to me anyways. I showed her 3 other credit cards and personal documents and she said unless it had a picture of me I couldn't have it? I get protocols.. But I showed you my entire life and a picture of the ID... Why make me go through all of that.

,Nadil Nawak,1,Delivery man who doesn't ring the bell who doesn't leave a review and get over it. I who thought I was badly off in France. There's a job to lose your arms why do a job you don't like? For the deliverer this one
,Lily Berte,1,"The post office opens at 8am according to the schedule

,Wasire Konseiga,2,
,Olivia Oh,5,"We decided to buy a postcard to mail home during our trip and a store owner directed us here. The post office have postcards available on site so you can write it and send it right away. The postcard was 1.00 CAD and postage to the US was 1.25 CAD. With tax I believe the total cost was about 3 dollars. I was really nervous because my French is not good at all despite my efforts, however the staff members speak good English which was like a blessing to us!!"

Big space.

,Joyce Chapman,5,"This office was great, we had a group of little girls in there wanting to send post cards home, they were very helpful and great with the girls.  Everyone was happy when they left."
,Tara,2,"Unfortunately I have had more than one negative experience with the woman who works evenings at this post office. She is immediately unfriendly, not helpful and makes you feel like you’re bothering her when it is literally her job. At first I wanted to give her the benefit of the doubt- maybe she had a bad day. But it’s been more than 3 times now that she is downright rude. All I was asking for was a price estimate for an item and she refused to check. Said I could look online. As if I hadn’t already tried that.

Meanwhile other times when I have been lucky enough to be served by another person, they were patient, kind, and helpful. Always asking if there’s anything else I need help with.

It makes me want to go to another post office just to avoid her."
,Hélène Ceccarelli,5,"The staff is smiling, friendly. He does everything he can to please you."
,L Cote,5,Great service! Nice welcome by smiling and friendly employees who were able to answer my questions.
,Lune Claire,2,"What a pity!... A super nice person but drowned in work because everyone or almost... wants to do business with her. We feel the competence, the empathy.. a parcel or mail is often emotional... and the other person has lost his smile forever I believe... in q.q. years, I have never seen her smile or say hello.. we have the impression that we are bothering her... in short: that's enough.. there are other post offices...paid by our taxes ... in addition to shipping costs...."
,bumblebee051,1,"Seriously, but what mediocre service... First, for the umpteenth time, the postman doesn't even ring my doorbell to deliver my package (My spouse is home at all times), then he returns it to the branch and I have to wait three days before I can pick it up... When I complain to the post office, they tell me there's nothing they can do... What kind of company answers that to its customers? Especially since I paid twice for your services; Once with Amazon shipping and the other time with my taxes! You really have to stop thinking that because it is a government service that you owe us nothing!"

,Émile Lapointe,2,"At the postal services I have most of the time no complaints about the service.

One of the clerks, on the other hand, has clearly been working for too long and considers himself to be above the rules of etiquette.

If only to respect the people he talks to or take their questions seriously.

It's time to do some staff turnover I think."
,Lorie-Anne Ouellet,1,"30 minutes to ship a package....because the lady keeps making mistakes and doesn't know what she is doing....very bad service!

,Kevin Orne,2,"Employees look down on people

We always seem to disturb

The confidential information is given aloud so the whole queue hears that Mrs. X wants to make a transfer of X amount to such person from such place.

,Laurence F,1,"Really slow service, more than fifteen customers in the queue and it takes more than 10 minutes to serve a customer... go elsewhere unless you have a lot of time to waste..."
,Christophe Gagné,1,Very slow service. The employees don't really know what to do as soon as we have a shipment that's the least bit unusual. They take forever in the back and leave customers with no service. I prefer to go to other service points.
,Véronique Marceau,1,"So is it complicated for you to put your good schedules on your bones&#%@ of parcel boxes?

Professionalism is not at Canada Post, that's clear"

,Pierre-Emmanuel LeMay,5,Simple and convenient. Operating hours allow to visit right before or after work.
,Christopher Bedard,1,"Worst service we have ever received for our business. A lady of a certain age was scolding one of her employees in front of us. We wanted to ask the lady her name, and she never wanted to give us her name, because she knew we were going to make a complaint. When we paid our account, we asked her for the keys to our post office box and she never wanted to give it to us. Lack of professionalism and competence on several levels."
,Steven Rancourt,1,"For me, poor service. Stupid lady every time. A package that I had sent there was returned on the pretext that I had refused it, even though the lady assured me that it would be kept there upon receipt. A large order. I re-shipped directly to my home with no problem. A word of advice, go or have it shipped to another post office."
,Marc-André Vigneault,1,"Closing hours on google 5:30. Closing time indicated by an employee 5:30. On the internal door of the building inscribed 4:30. Yet I arrived at 5:00 am and there were people. I waited until 5:30, then people left. So much you stood there chatting and getting paid from 4:30 p.m. to 5:30 p.m.... you should have left it open!"

,Kamm Johnson,1,I came here yesterday and they said it wasn’t open until noon… you should update your hours on Google/online if they’re not correct.

,Andrew Sarasin,2,Lady at the desk was rude yesterday. She clicked her fingers to get my attention when it was my turn. I told her I'm not a dog and she responded by saying it's because I have other things to do here.. Usually I don't have a problem going here but I guess it wasn't her best day. Maybe it's time she retires..
,Marie-Ève Mimeault,1,"I moved this morning, after having CHECKED the opening hours on the website, already knowing that the opening hours are really limited (for a public service paid with our taxes, in addition!). I imagine that we did not see fit to inform tax-paying citizens that from now on the counter would be closed on Saturdays. I'm on the eve of having to take time off to be able to pick up my passport if I want to be able to go on vacation! Ridiculous!"
,Denis Hamel,1,Access hours really suck. Very difficult to pick up a package when it's only open during working hours. It's supposed to be a public post office. We pay for it with our taxes. We should then have a somewhat decent service. Open at least one weeknight or Saturday morning. I have nothing to say however against the staff who have always been helpful.

,Mike C. Chung,3,The Canada Post Office is a section inside the Pharmacy.  The post office gets 3 stars as it was closed on Monday.  But you can purchase a stamp from the pharmacy cashier if you are sending an envelope within Canada.  All other mail will require the services from the Post Office staff. They are opened on weekdays except for Monday from 9 am to 5 pm.

,Eric Pednault,5,Good service
,Marie-Ève Tremblay,1,"One hour wait to post a standard package for a company and this is not the first time that the waiting time has been very very long. They are three employees to respond to a single customer. I can understand a questioning, but there was only me left in line. It wouldn't have been difficult to complete my transaction which lasts 2 minutes while the other two employees try to understand the other customer who was not prepared enough. After that, at the checkout, instead of apologizing for the waiting time, they dare to tell me that ''I look in a hurry''. Unheard of and I am usually patient and understanding."
,capucine doire,5,"A lovely staff, who took the time to listen to me and explain to me how to do it. A big thank you ☺️"
,Kelly Sue Lambert,1,"I have never seen so much incompetence in one place. Service not only very very slow, but inadequate. The ladies who work there do not check the state of their photocopies (sold overpriced -20 pages =11$) when I return to tell them they realize that they have run out of ink. I come back 10 minutes later to find that they are unable to change their ink cartridges. I then ask for a refund, of course. Same problem, they still don't know what to do. So it took me 35 minutes of my time to leave without my refund, because apparently some activity in the backstore was more urgent than my refund which I had been waiting for at least 15 minutes. Are we kidding ourselves?"

,Mealprep Burgers,1,"I have never received a package with Canada Post. I always had to go get it directly at the counter. The delivery men ring the doorbell of my apartment block and hasten to flee with their truck, leaving a note saying to pick it up at the counter. I understand that you have several packages to deliver but you could at least wait 2 minutes for me to come down or leave it in the secure lockers that my apartment block has purchased especially for delivery people. When there's a maximum return date on the package it's also really boring not being able to return it in time when it's mostly your fault for the delay."
,Marc-André Desmeules,1,"Seriously, is it possible to deliver your Collis on time once in a while!! When Canada Post delivers my packages I never have them, but NEVER!! hold on. But all the other delivery companies are able to do it!! Is there anyone who can explain to me why!!!??"
,Perfector “Pc”,3,"The lady who works at the counter during the week talks to us with a condescending air and has no tact; she shouldn't be working with the public. I ask her a question and answer me as if I were thick, luckily she does her job well otherwise I would have put 1 star. No more, I'm going there, I'm going to go to the other one, even if it's further away, at least it speaks to you like people."

,ken_ obi_x,1,It's the worst Canada post you can have honestly! I have just gone to see to ask for my parcel because they say that it is delivered well pi finally the delivery man is wrong of address when I am 1min from this Canada post! To be as lost as that as well changed job! Here's my opinion 🤷 a lot of improvement to be done and change as much professional as the staff.. it's pitiful
,Sébastien (Pensum),2,No answer at the counter at 11:57. I spoke with a postman (in the parking lot) who was on his way and he gladly took my package.

,Mohammad Abu-Marzouk,5,"I recently visited a Canada Post office in Mississauga Ontario inside Shoppers Drug Mart 5035 Hurontario Street and was blown away by the exceptional service and support provided to local small businesses.

The staff was not only professional but also extremely friendly and welcoming, as soon as I walked in, I was greeted with warm smiles and a genuine desire to help you find the best shipping solutions for your needs.

If you're looking for a Canada Post office that truly goes above and beyond to support local small businesses, look no further than the office run by FILIZ and her team Kiran and Manjusha.

I had the pleasure of being assisted by all FILIZ, who went above and beyond to ensure that I received the best possible service. She took the time to understand my business needs and offered a variety of solutions that would help save our company money. Her dedication and willingness to help left a lasting impression on me.

Not only is the staff incredibly knowledgeable and helpful, but they also go out of their way to promote small business programs that can save you money on shipping costs.

FILIZ, in particular, is an absolute gem - she's always eager to help and finds creative ways to save our company money while still ensuring our documents arrive on time.

Overall, I highly recommend this Canada Post office Location to anyone looking for exceptional service and support for their small business. The staff is knowledgeable, friendly, and always willing to go above and beyond to ensure that every client is satisfied and happy.
If you're a small business owner looking for a shipping partner that cares about your success, this is the office for you!"
,Cynthia Yi,1,Extremely horrible customer service at the checkout desk. The person rejected provide service. Instead he shouting at me and accusing me why I did not use self checkout. Management should clarify the job duties to this person and educate him that’s how he gets pay.
,Kevin Arrata,1,Complete incompetence. Make up their own rules on what IDs they want to accept. Uneducated in their roles and unaware of how to speak with customers. An abysmal experience all around that I’ll be contacting head office about.
,Majdi Shahein,1,"Horrible experience today with the supervisor (she said she’s “the one”).

We immediately made a complaint at the head office and were told the complaint is being taken very seriously and was escalated to ""the right people"".

Let’s see, we’ll not be going to this Canada Post as long she still works there."
,N. Gomes,1,"I went to the Canada Post outlet at the shoppers drug Mart store inside the square one mall.  The guy, Hawza, was terrible in the sense that he had a long line of customers but continued having a personal conversation on his cellphone.  How is it possible that this person could ignore customers while venting with the other person at the end of the line about ""a colleague who was fired and has now ruined the situation for the other employees""."
,Marium Owais,1,"Lady behind Canada post counter was very rude. When i went a couple of days ago to pick up my parcel there was a sign saying they are temporarily closed and the estimated time of opening is 12 noon and I was reading that when she came up to me and rudely and loudly said we are closed, we are closed. And I replied. Yes I read the sign. So mean. She truly needs some classes in manners and customer service."
,nicholas sangineto,1,The lady was not patient at all. When i was talking face to face to her suddenly she left and start do something else without to say anything to me . But she was listening me. How polite peoples are in Toronto…
,M Lau,1,Older lady behind the counter was incompetent and rude. Asked you a question and immediately just spoke over you blaming the customer on why she couldnt do her job correctly. She should be let go. I will not be back.
,ryan douros,1,"The woman with the glasses is very rude! An elderly man asked her a question while we were talking to her and she yelled at him and told him to wait his turn. Very disrespectful, very unprofessional."
,Shivam Verma,5,"The young lady working here is too good. Very supportive and friendly. I have seen many customers being rude to her without any reason  like today there was an issue with the system for some postal code and she suggested him to have a google search but the person insisted on going back and then after blamed her for his runarounds. I feel sorry for her and came just to have a say on other user’s allegation of terminating her. She is good and for the sake of new system, please treat the employees in humanely manner. And just how I see people post negative comments more than positive ones, please show the other side too."

,Vishal Narayan,1,This is not how anything works. You can't just randomly shut off the post office because you feel so even though it it within your official business hours. This is an essential service.
,Jamie,5,I've experienced very satisfied service. The lady who helped me to process a package was very sweet and professional. Excellent Post Office in my town! Thank you for your amazing service. 🙂👍👍
,Hemantkumar Vaghela,1,Very bad behaviour of person named John. Not giving response properly and his behaviour is very weird like just stand up their to return everyone with any reason. Behaving like his private store and not Canada post.

,Austin Boucinha,1,"The worst Canada Post location in Brampton by far. It’s so frustrating that all my undelivered packages end up here because it means that I have to deal with the poor positioning of this location and the incredibly rude and lazy staff that work here.

Also, if you’re going to have your employees take breaks @CanadaPost, that’s perfectly well and good, but make sure you have someone covering the front desk at all times! There’s absolutely no reason why taxpayers should need to be waiting upwards of 30 minutes at the location to be served. Can’t even believe this is an issue in the first place, what a joke!"
,Ishpal Singh,1,I wish i can give zero star. The lady behind the counter is so rude. Management needs to see this and she needs to be replaced.
,Hero Certified Burgers Derry & McLaughlin,1,"Avoid this location at all cost. I had to complete a verification process for opening a bank account with ""Simplii Financial""which simply turned out to be the most painful and complicated process of opening a bank account. The bank emailed me a letter with a barcode and some instructions to follow as part of the requirements to verify my identification.  The letter clearly states that a valid providential driver license is sufficient enough to complete the verification process. I took my driver license and the barcode to this post office,  but I was denied by the man with British/ Scottish accent behind the counter for a ""simple"" verification process. He wanted me to show him a mail or bank statement which also shows my residential address even though I had already provided him my valid government ID showing my residential address which was my driver license. I told him the letter that he was scanning shows a different instruction, but he said he didn't care. He didn't even bother to even read it. I asked him if he could clarify that from his end becuase that letter wasn't from a small online merchant . According to the email I received, Simplii fincacial( CIBC's banks subsidiary)  partnered up with Canada post and they would be sending the same instructions to millions of others potential clients....  all he kept saying was, he didn't care and why I didn't carry my insurance policy with me... I asked for his supervisor and showed her the letter, but she also tried to justify his requirement by saying the Canada Post system asked them for such requirements.....

I had never been required  for a proof of my address while providing my valid driver license which already has my address. I carry a mail with my address when I need to show  government IDs like my passport which has no address on it .... common sense. I told him I could show him my passport if there is two peices of IDs required as it is also a common practice for the banks, but he wanted me to show him a  mail with my address. This is the first time I'm requested for such a strength thing at a post office. Since when we are ignoring the legitimacy of the government IDs and look for authenticity of a bill?

I finally called Canada post customer service and the rep confirmed  that I didn't have to provide a secondary mail address as a proof of my address when  my driver license was valid. Non of the two staff I dealt with had any clue with the standard requirements and I ended up wasting my time because the man had his own theory of verification.  I filed a complaint about this location so no one else is gonna waste their time and energy like I did.

Do yourself a favor and avoid this location at all cost."
,Simon W,4,Located inside the Shopper Drugmart in the back corner by the food. Very busy around 5pm when everyone finishes work. They only had 1 person working so be prepared to wait. Staff was friendly and processed everything correctly.
,Gerald M,3,Sadly the reviews are accurate. Long lines as the demographic of customers range from very frail seniors to young folks. Thought I’d try this location but it’s a long wait. Seniors do love chatting with the agents at the front reception of this canada post location. Recommend detouring to another location if you are unable to wait at least 15 minutes or longer.
,Ashish Sharma,5,"Contrary to all the reviews here, i went yesterday for delivering a package at canada post around 2pm and it took around 2 mins to get the work done. The lady at the counter was also helpful. Maybe it depends on what time you go there"
,Mika Hamilton,1,"Waited 75 minutes in line to drop off a return package. There’s only one computer/register for a busy downtown location, and I see multiple reviews stating the same issue of very long waits. I’m surprised this hasn’t been addressed."
,colin menezes,5,"Had a great experience at this Canada Post outlet. The gentleman behind the counter has a lot of experience and is precise and diligent in his work. The outlet is amazing, and has everything that you need right from stamps to collectors coins and all kinds of packing boxes etc. I had gone twice, once for a gift card and then again to get a reloadable Visa card. I also got rolls of stamps and everything that I needed was readily available. Service was quick too. When I reached there were 4 people infront of me and yet I was done and out from there on less than 10mins. This place is truely a neighborhood friendly post office."
,candice marshall,1,There is a very disrespectful so called women there name Armela if you get her as a cashier she is so unprofessional she treats customers like her dog she disowns. Please hire better staff thank you. For one she does not even say hello. She comes with attitude chewing her gum. Then when you are handing her money she barely budges out her hand to receive the money. Last time I was there about a week ago I got her as a cashier and same situation. That’s why this time I had to speak up. She laughed as I told her to she said I was “waiting” that’s her excuse as to why she didn’t put her hand out she literally held her hand close to her stomach. So I have to lean over the counter to hand her the money???? That’s what she was “waiting” for ? Really terrible excuse what are u waiting for I first held the money out and when I noticed she wasn’t budging I had to lean forward to put it in her hand. This is not customer service this is beyond unprofessional. She has to go she doesn’t say hello or how are you just super rude.
,JE MA,2,"Absurdly long line ups. Despite people waiting a long time, only one SUPER SLOW staff member oblivious to people waiting.This post office is infuriating. Hie more staff. Hire better staff."
,Melissa Sinclair,1,"There should be more mail drop boxes in my neighborhood! I live at Dundas and Mabelle. There's no box for putting my mail to send out in at all around here. Unless I walk 1000 feet , which I can't due to being disabled."
,Onemore Snottyyoutubeopinion,1,"When I went in yesterday (Sunday morning), there was a line of clients spanning across 4 aisles in Shopper's. Typical of the Post Office, there was one employee working. If you like under-staffed with long line ups this is the post office location for you. I simply walked out. Lining up for over an hour to send one letter by ExpressPost is just absurd."
,Joonwoo,2,"In despite of handing over the shipment to clerk at this post office, my shipment has never been scanned for the update and potentially got lost in transit. Scanning Barcode of the shipment is simple task and only take less than 10 second of their time to before put in the Bin. It was a mid aged white lady who worked on Sept 15th 2021 7:55pm, I know exact time of drop since I was rushing in to make it before office being closed.

Furthermore, I followed up with CP customer service, they will investigate and resolve this case by Oct 12th which is 1 month away from now.

People should make sure to see if clerk is scanning your item. Don't get comfortable and trust this people doing their job right.

I send out multiple shipments for business so using this office frequently, and I am satisfied with Asian men and women works during the day time they are helpful. But this happen for the first time when I drop off my package at the evening and other clerk was there."
,Harry in Downtown,1,"The staff do not know how to print out the label which was created and paid by client. He ask we go somewhere to print it out. Finally, he use photocopy machine to take label on my phone screen. Disappointed service compare with another location of Canada Post"
,Blake Wallace,1,"Everytime I come to this location I have to wait upwards of 20 mins, it’s gotten absurd."
,J G,5,"Friendly staff, always help me find best value on shipping rates.
Line up can be long but that is common at most CP locations"
,THUNDER CLOUD,5,"This Canada Post Office inside Shoppers is convienienltly located.
♿ Accesible enrtrance at the corner of Queen Street East & Parliament Street on South side of Queen Street in Historic Corktown.
Although it is at the back right hand corner inside Shoppers.
I have found the customer service & handling courteously all good.
The service my family & local residence have used for years in addition to mine for personal mail as well as for other business purposes we have been pleased with.They also sell stamps at the Post Office counter.
Envelopes & other items you may need for mailing to the left of the counter. I noticed the employees are hard working & handling mail arriving in a timely way. The small if any line ups at all prove they got this all moving quite well.

,Joel Rose,5,"I've been there many times and haven't had any issues. The guy tonight (Jin?) was friendly and dropped everything to assist me. There's parking, which is helpful if you're picking up big heavy items. I use this as my Amazon pickup point."

I appreciate the help you gave me today."
,vivek kapoor,5,"I posted a registered letter today and lost my tracking receipt etc. I traced my steps back but couldn't find the receipt. I had the most amazing experience with Post Canada employee "" Magzina"" who not only helped me with my tracking details but also gave a photocopy of my envelope. She was busy, but efficient and compassionate. Thanks and God bless you!"

,war pigg6,5,"I've been coming to this post office location for years and the new staff are friendly, courteous and very helpful. The manager, Laura, has done an exceptional job at turning this post office around. She deserves high praise for dealing with the high number of rude and disrespectful customers that cannot follow simple instructions.

Keep up the great work!"
,Sven Zorz,5,"Usually 5 - 10 people in line, but wait time is not too long. Oriented to this post office for many years, having very good experience."
,Winston,4,"Small location so it tends to have longer lines than other locations but I have never experienced any issues from the staff here.

All interactions have been courteous and prompt once you get to the counter.

Some of the internal logistics could be better to speed up the process or cut down on the confusion but seems to be doing their best with what they have for the most part."
,Monica Ribeiro,1,"I work customer service and let me tell you, no matter how rude a customer was to me, I never took it out on anyone. I came in this morning ( Monday July 10) and the lady working was ABSOLUTELY rude to 3 people in front of me. I can’t believe how she has a job within customer service"
,Meaghan MacKenzie,5,Elsid was the nicest and most helpful post office worker I have ever encountered! I've shipped hundred of items from post offices all over. I would recommend this post office over other ones that are closeby! He even taped up the box instead of making me feel terrible for not bringing my own.
,The Den Toronto,2,"Service agents at this location have no clue what they're doing.

From not knowing how to work a is a debit machine and print off a receipt.

To then sell me the wrong package for National delivery versus provincial.

Then refuse to give me a refund on it.

Once that was all settled she then took the slip off the package and Gave it back to me. When I asked her why she was handing it back she said well isn't it yours don't you want to take it.... Yes ma'am it's mine but I'm just paid you $25 to ship it. ?!?!"
,Un Identified,5,Super helpful asian lady let me use her phone to call another location to see if my package was there. Who does that? What a nice lady.
,Jana Aridi,1,"this is by for the worst location of post office available in Toronto. The staff is extremely rude. They are severely understaffed.
The lady who was working at the time I was in decided that since the store closed at exactly 9 o’clock everyone else who has been waiting there could no longer get their packages in because the store closes at nine and she refuses to take anyone else. how does that make any sense??,
This is the first time i’ve experienced a store do that. usually the line up is cut off not the people already in line. extremely unhappy with my experience and i will avoid this post office at all costs"
,Charles D,1,"If I had to sum this Canada Post office in one word, it would be FRUSTRATION! Staff get confused easily and be prepared to repeat yourself multiple times. If the line has two people in it, I am walking away. Good luck of you have no other choice button use this location."
,Jaqueline Colton,5,"I come mostly on weekends and sometimes during the weekdays to pick up several parcels. Marta is always very friendly, and gives amazing customer service whenever I am sending, picking up or have any questions.

Other ladies such as Yasmin are also lovely and always greeting you with a smile on their face!"
,ZV,5,"I have used their services at this location since they moved in about 6 years ago  and found the staff to always  be very professional, polite and patient.
(There is a new male  staff member ,however, that often has a lackluster attitude.)"
,Emily Griffith,1,Absolutely rude and not helpful with anything! Any time I asked a question I was given the “I don’t know response” every single time. The older woman with the glasses doesn’t know how to do her job and I’m so fed up with her lack of customer service. Please hire people who actually have KNOWLEDGE of what they’re doing… absolutely ridiculous.
,Joe Ma,1,"Extremely bad attitude. I didn't see anyone at the counter and the bell on it was not obvious, so I looked into the room and I apologized for it. However, he started being racist to me and my country. Even the Shopper's employee came to apologize for him. This is absolutly not acceptable!!!"
,tbsp,5,"I’ve always had a positive experience at this pharmacy-connected Canada Post. The workers there may get to you a bit slow because it is a quiet, low-volume location, but they are helpful and polite. Deserves a better rating!"
,A LW,5,my favourite location!! lines can def get long but Ivy and all the workers there are genuinely the loveliest people who I always like seeing when i ship my packages
,Josephine Fenoglio,4,Eventhough there is only one person behind the counter she is always pleasant and helpful!
,Jorge Andres Niño Vargas,5,Today was my first time using the service of Canada post. It was super fast and simple.
,east coaster,4,"I find the staff courteous, friendly and efficient. Those people who say otherwise are liars. It's the same folks there every day, and they're always courteous despite having to deal with your attitudes. Just be quiet, wait your turn, and mind your manners. If you're incapable of this, stay home. Obviously, there's sometimes a line, but it moves along very quickly. They're doing the best they can, so be more patient. The only downside is the shipping supplies are overpriced compared to the dollar store which is just up the street."
,Christina Dong,1,"Very unprofessional because they did not update their working hours on holidays! It says it’s open on Sunday July 3, but when I come to the door it said it’s open until July 4th. Also, on the door it’s open hours are 9-6 M to F, 11-4 Sat, however, it’s website says opening from 8 am. Very disappointed."
,Fangtong Liu刘芳彤,1,"They charge you a dollar for using their tape to tape your box. In my past 10 years of experience using Canada Post, that’s never the case and the ladies behind the counter rudely disagreed. I’m never going to this location again"
,Mister Mobile,5,I bought a postcard with prepaid postage for international mail. No line up 10AM. :-) Lots has change during this pandemic.
,Elizabeth Davis,5,The young lady was able to help me register a forwarding address quickly and accurately while maintaining a cheerful attitude. I was so grateful after being turned down at two other nearby locations with the excuse that their systems were down. This will be my location of choice from now on!
,Adam Moran,1,They need to update their hours. Their actual opening time is 9am. I went out of my way to pick up a package before work today only to find out they were closed. A waste of time
,Prabhjyot Kaur,1,I went there on the weekend my god lady’s attitude is unbelievable. I was there around 3:30 I believe the closing time on weekends are 5:00 pm. I was about to stand in line she said I am close after the guy standing in front of me. There were hardly 4-5 people.
,Biswas Sharma,1,"Omg 😳
The lady is very very very slow. I was in the line for 2 hr to pick up my package. She asked to go another location if we need faster service."
,Milan Patel,5,"Zarish, was great. She was waiting to take a break but due to rush hour she couldn’t. She helped everyone quickly as she can."

,Jason M,5,"Usually pretty good. Some staff are more helpful than others. Ayesha is always so helpful and pleasant to interact with, and very good at her job. She recognizes me and let's me know when I have a package to pick up, such good customer service from her."
,Artur Delta6,1,"Says open - ""hours may vary on a holiday""  If your closed please notify google with proper hours.   Instead customers will arrive with packages and then be sent home with packages."
,eggie dee,5,staff in general are really nice here! they're friendly and efficient even on the busiest days!!
,Jos Y,1,"Came here to do an Amazon return, I had a picture of the label and asked if they could print it. Said no, so I had to go and print it myself elsewhere and came back with it. I asked them if they had tape for the label and they just said ""I'll do it"" she scanned then label I provided and printed out an adhesive one and threw the one I provided out."
,Mega K,1,"Come regularly twice a week at night time. The gentle man who is really friendly and helpful.

Today came around 2:50pm to pick up the stuff with a elder lady and she refused to give me the stuff even I showed her the proof of delivery notice, business card, my ID card, the proof business license.
I was wondering what she was looking for.
I asked her what do want from me she said paid stuff@&@&@&&@. I have no idea what it was , and just left because I can not deal with her.

I don know what is wrong with her. Why she made up thing so complicated just to pick up stuff.

And now I leave my stuff there because I can not pick it up. Really really really my bad day ever that meet this lady. Wasting my time."
,Megan Chown,5,"I stopped in at this Post Office located in Shoppers to mail my wedding invitations tonight. The two associated working there tonight were SO wonderful. I didn't want to lick all of the envelopes (for obvious reasons) so they helped me dab water on the back of them from the sponge thing they have, and help me count and put stamps on everything. They were so sweet and I really appreciated the help. I'll definitely be back again! Thank you so much."
,Luna Moon,1,Horrible customer service. They lie about what you can and cannot ship just because they are lazy. Go to a real Canada post location instead and not this strange dirty convenience store posing as one.
,Rin W,1,"Got a slip in the mail to pick up a package.  On the slip it states operating hours are 8a-9p.  The doors were closed at 8:30p.  A sign at the post office states 8a-7p collection and 8a-9p service.
Why does my slip not give me the correct pick up times?!  Fix this."
,Manoj Srivatsa,1,"Being very unprofessional, the computer were we use to print papers are in Chinese. I asked for the assistance to print, and they printed wrongly. I was asked to pay for the print. I refused to pay because it was not my mistake. Very much disappointed with this Canada post."
,Ajay Adigopal,5,"The best Canada post ever!!!!

The staff actually know what they are doing , I came in for Police clearance at the consulate general of India.
And I got all my documents set and ready from this amazing Canada post location .

They have xerox , photo printing , photo service for passport photos or any size tbh ."
,Mehak Sakhuja,1,"I wish i could give 0 stars or in negative. I went here today to pick up a parcel and a sweet lady told me that i need to have physical ID to collect it and since the weather was bad, i confirmed the timings and she told me that the store timings are the same. I came in at around 5:30 PM again with my ID and Mr. Lu ( I’m not sure if that’s his real name). He slammed the door on my face and showed me a hand sign. He refused to help me and when i asked him a question, he very rudely said “No, i have already said we are closed”. I didn’t expect such behaviour from Canada Post. Worst customer service experience."
,Khushi,4,24x7 secured location. Security desk is not very helpful. Channel through Canada Post Online Customer Care before approaching this location. Utmost important to gather the supervisor’s name on duty to retrieve anymore information or document. Security desk will not be able to help unless you have a name (not just the case number)
,nick Boskovic,1,Horrible company! They steal people's stuff.  Litteraly they delayed my order now for 2 weeks at the  facilty while it's stuck on prossed  . Canada post is a bunch of crooks.  And states to on section 356 section 1 that yall are liable  for my package so if it does t show up I'll sue. I want my package and yall ai t gonna be playing  no monkey business  games
,Tyler Shiffer,1,"Pay for ems & receive standard service shipping speeds...
Canada post has no respect for its community, Admin processes aren't attend to with any haste.
Japanese post run circles around us, they consistently move packages around the world faster then we can manage to move within province."
,Lily Zhang,5,It's a huge place with lots of mail processing equipment. Clean and organized in general. People working here are generally professional and courteous.
,Cecilia S_sus,1,"I couldn’t understand how can Canada post took so long to deliver my package which is supposed to be delivered in January but here we are half way through April. And after I applied two service tickets, they finally told me my package was either stolen or lost, End of story."
,Giselle Segovia,1,"Very disappointed in the service I received today - although I must say that the majority of my experience with Canada Post employees at this location have been without issue and very positive. However, I have consistently received bad service from one employee in particular (unfortunately didn't catch his name - orange hair with glasses). I am a small business owner and I rely on Canada Post to mail my handmade jewelry. I have consistently used letter mail as a cost effective way to deliver my items and I never have any issues with other employees. Because my items are small, the package meets the standard sizing to be sent through lettermail. However, this particular employee consistently refuses to send my items via letter mail because it ""isnt a document"" and must instead be sent as a parcel. There is nothing on the Canada post website that states this. In fact, it says lettermail examples can be ""Any other mail you choose to send which meets the applicable qualifications"" which my item does. Also the price difference between letter mail vs a parcel is VERY significant. Despite telling him I have consistently used lettermail without issue he still refused and said verbatim ""If you are mailing this through ME it needs to go as a parcel"". So this guy is just condescending for no reason? How am I getting completely different service from other employees? Makes no sense. I have no other choice but to go another day and avoid him completely in the future. All other employees have been nothing but lovely!"
,Marci Halls,1,I have never used this location. I have a business account that I mentioned 10 times and this is the first time in over 6 months they told me I MUST fill out the customs form on the app or they will not serve me. I had 2 packages with just 1 item in them each and all other locations just asked me the questions and value them moved on. This woman was rude then forgot to put it under my account and wasn’t happy when I asked her to redo the labels so I could get my discount and have the shipments reflected in my account. Shipping 3 boxes ended up taking me a half hour and then when I paid she made sure to let me know how little I saved doing it all over again. I will never use this location again.
,Henry Hess,5,"I've mailed and shipped a lot from this location over the years. The folks here are efficient and always nice to everyone. That's saying something because I've seen them have to deal with some genuinely terrible customers.

Let's be honest, Canada Post as an organisation isn't perfect, but this Canada Post location is excellent. If everyone else associated with Canada Post worked as well as the folks here I'd have a higher opinion of them!"
,Arun Guha,1,Came here on march 26th around 2pm and the guy said there was no way for him to print my shipping label and that I’d have to print it somewhere else but on the website it says they have label printing services for people who don’t have printers
,Jennifer Sedgewick,5,"I don't know who was working on January 12th around 5:00 pm but they deserve a raise/some praise. It was quite busy and the customers who were holding up the line were impatient and insufferable (complaining about prices and shipping times as if the worker had any control over those things). Despite that, the worker exercised a lot of patience and was extremely helpful when it was finally my turn.
I can understand that why so many postal workers are salty is because of some of the customers, but it makes going as a customer a not so great time. I'm so glad that my new post office (I just recently moved) will be a pleasant experience (at least with that worker there)!"
,Kristina R,1,"Rude customer service, giving attitude for no reason, unhelpful, shouting at all of the customers (over five witnesses) in line that they are closing in 20 min but we have formed a line up close to the end of her shift. I arrived at 4:35, its not my fault you work slowly. Get a better job if you hate yours so much?"
,Ryan Desjardins,1,I’m standing here in shoppers for 15 minutes an employee name Latoya a manager supposedly of the post office of at shoppers I’m not sure which started yelled screamed at customers that she is quitting if she doesn’t get on lunch and isn’t accepting any more packages for the day. I have never been yelled at and approached this way there was 2 others in line behind me that stayed to argue and fight now but if there was a negative star system Latoya and shoppers queensway would get negative 4 just terrible I was shaking and not sure what I did to deserve such terrible treatment I will avoid this shoppers and go to Rexall for all my needs I suggested anyone who reads this does the same save yourself a screaming at
,Marinela Gheorghe,1,"I was used to such good customer service at this Canada Post location thanks to Rebecca, who’s a pleasure to deal with.

Sadly, until today.  I was confronted by the most shockingly rude new person/staff member working behind the Canada Post counter! Her level of rudeness and appallingly bad attitude left me astounded at the fact that this person has a job dealing with the public and having to provide assistance/information in regards to her job as a Canada Post employee! Surely this organization cannot be so hard pressed for staff members as to employ someone who actively insults customers needing assistance with their mail!

In shock at the dismissive, abrupt attitude, and having left without receiving any assistance other than having a form thrown in my face and being told to call the general head office, I asked to speak to the Shoppers manager. He was too flustered to receive any constructive feedback, and gave little confidence that he was disposed to take any action towards improving this situation at all. Even though he said she is under his report.
If anything, I seemed to have inconvenienced him as well.
Bad culture and bad attitudes all around here. Go someplace else if you can. Save them from treating you like a nuisance instead of a customer."
,Alicia Pereira,2,"Not sure why the woman staffed here is so moody but I just now called for information on a package and asked for advice as per what I was told from another location. The woman had attitude, spoke over me and sounded generally miserable. Additionally, she attempted to deny giving me information until I told her another location readily and without issue gave me that information (and suggested I start with that question when speaking to the next location). She responded with ""and I'm telling you sometimes the post man does and sometimes he doesn't come here, but give me your address (as she was absolutely able to tell me if packages from my address go to that location or not - which she ultimao did do). Do her and yourself a favour and take your packages to the next nearest Canada Post."
,Genevieve Doucette,1,Horrible customer service and now they've started closing randomly at 5pm. I called to double check (since I've gone twice when they say they're open and they're not) but all I got was 9 and click...hung up on. Why are people in jobs that require some semblance of people skills and have none? I avoid this location as much as I can for business packages.
,Minis Tran,5,"The lady working here is so nice and helpful. Even the line up was long when I was there, she gently took care of each customer (no rush AT ALL) to make sure things correctly and cost saving. There was only her, so it made sense if you have to wait a bit in line. I believe people who are friendly with children and elderly have good heart, and it’s her!"
,Rice Potato,1,"There is a woman at this location that really needs an attitude check.  Without provocation she is gruff in her tone and unfriendly.  You are lucky to have a job.  If you reported to me I would fire you.  Learn some common courtesy skills and consider greeting someone with hello before you start your ""barking""."
,Evgheni Barducov,5,Nice staff is working there. Can be unexpectedly closed from time to time. But no blame.
,Shanie Kuo,5,The staff on shift tonight is an angle. She helped me with my parcel despite the after work hour. Its a pity that I was in a hurry and forgot to ask her name. Just want to give a shout out to her here for being so helpful.
,Priscilla Za,1,"Slowest service ever! Never feel bad or apologise. When I say slow its all day all week long, at anytime, and major lack of training employees and professionalism!"
,Wei Xu,1,"Arrived at 4:56pm on Saturday, and the lady refused to offer service. Even though I said I just needed a stamp. No wonder this center has such a bad review."
,Tim ಠ_ಠ “Psycho” Banana Cheese Cake,4,"Overall it's a fine experience, fast and simple process for picking up packages. Clerk could take more time with some customers (the ones that keep on talking about things other than the packages)... I don't blame the staff. 4 out of 5 due to the hours listed on Google vs the hours shown in the email.. can be confusing.."
,Mijoter Mijoter,1,"Today we wanted to send our money to Ukraine through MoneyGram, in our country is war...and this woman from Canada Post firstly asked about our address in Canada, but we're newcomers and have only temporary address in this mean secondly she rejected with MoneyGram transfer.
We just wants to cry
Wasting time and 0 result
She doesn't answer why she couldn't help with transfer money to Ukraine
Worse service and uncorrect behavior("
,Julian Zapanta,1,"I've been waiting in line and I was the 3rd person in the queue. It's been 20 mins all I wanted to do was drop off a package the Filipino girl working today at 9:30AM on Aug 21, 2017 should learn how to prioritize. If she dealt with the things that would take longer after there were 5 people waiting in line things would be much simpler for her and everybody else. Thank god she doesn't work in a hospital as a nurse because I guarantee due to lack of prioritizing her patients would die and she'd be the cause of it."
,XY XY,1,This is arguably the worst Canada post office in the city and the worst i have ever experienced in my life. The clerk was late 10 min today with opening and she is so slow that it takes forever to finish with one single customer. Federal Canada post should shut down this post or change the owner of the licence as soon as possible !
,Michael Bergman,1,Would prefer they honor the hours they post publicly to Google Maps instead of hanging signs on the counter stating that they're on break. They're unreliable and it's inconsiderate.

,wild cloud,5,Kind staff ♥️
,Nika Niknam,5,"In this office, a young kind gentleman named “Aboud” works. He has a great sense of customer service. He always provide you with useful information. He explains everything with patience. I couldn't have posted some of my documents without his help and he makes me feel at ease. I believe he deserves a raise."
,Rosie Keli,1,"Terrible and disrespectful employee.The lady was extremely rude and not helpful. It’s one thing to not be able to help out a costumer but it’s another to not even try and disregard them completely. I told the lady how I was never asked if I wanted tracking number or not. She did not believe me. It is my 10th time properly sending package through this exact post office and I always asked for tracking number. I send important documents why would I not ask for a tracking number. I understand they might have made a mistake or maybe even I did but for her to be this level of disrespectful and straight up mean and rude. Yeah no, if you don’t want to get your package lost and have employees disrespect you don’t come here. Terrible service. Human to human you got to treat people with respect. Never coming here again."
,Xiaodan Zhang,1,"A counter named Jenny was very rude and irresponsible. She was not able to give appropriate instructions to customers who mail their passports to the visa center for the first time, even though I double-checked with her beforehand. Once she found something was not right afterwards,  she just said it was the customer's thing, anyway, it had nothing to do with her, the customer should have asked her, otherwise she won't give any instructions in detail. I don't think she cannot understand how important the passport is to everyone, but she doesn't care about any customer, and just shirks responsibility and blames others."
,Manik Mahajan,5,The staff is very helpful. I would recommend if you are sending out your documents because the staff is already aware about the different envelopes to use and how to send out these documents.
,Karim Beydoun,4,Only 1 employee is there.. The line is big specially during peak hour. Should consider adding more employees to speed up the service. Otherwise it's a good post service as expected.
,Lakhvirkaur,1,"ridiculous experience of receiving the item. it’s been 19 days i haven’t received my item and when i call to the customer service they said sender has to claim. but i don’t need the money i need my item. so bad delivery service of canada post. my item should be returned back to the sender address after 10 days at least but nothing is done like that. i am so unsatisfied with the service. 😣😣😣😣😣

i will never choose canada post ever to send my items. never ever

update on my lost bag - 4/4/2023
Never received… lost forever"
,Tirupathi Rao Papeneni,5,This is a good for business spot and it was kind of slow because they have only employee and and she is mid 40+ but she is working good
,Mai Omran,4,"A bit of a slow line process, employees were friendly, helpful, and efficient"
,Hiten Patel,1,"Extremely worst Canadian post service till date in my life , guy with the glasses just ignored my queries and behaved like get out of my store. Unexpected behavior . However same question was solved politely  by staff OF  JEAN - COUTE (Canadian post)"
,Marie O,1,"PR CARD STOLEN HERE

PLEASE HELP!

I left the card on the counter after using it as piece of ID. I came back the next day and it was nowhere to be found.

The people working here say they didn't see it so someone must have found it and taken it with them.

I have an emergency trip to go see a relative who is dying and I need my card to return to Canada. I will be stranded and unable to re-enter for weeks without it. If you found it PLEASE GIVE IT BACK."
,G N,1,I had the worst customer service experience ever. The employee who assisted me was of a certain age and incredibly rude. I was shocked when she started raising her voice at me this Friday afternoon. Her behavior was completely unprofessional and unacceptable
,Stephanie Rao,1,"I came at 12pm at the officially open time and the lady was just arrived so it took time to open the cashier. Okay I understand! But I can’t wait I leave. Then I came again afternoon 4:45pm, then they don’t let me in! Cuz they have to close the cashier sharp at 5pm! And there is too much people in front That’s ridiculous!!"
,M A,1,"Very bad service.
Don't even go there if u want to recive or send money via moneygram. First they are rude and not respectful.
Second they always don't have cash to give you your transaction."
,Harshil Soni,1,"The branch isn’t keeping up with the customers, there are 3 desk and hardly one person working in there, we are 15 lined up for the service 🫡"
,M V,4,"July 13th at around 4PM employee name is Latifa
I go to this Canada post quite often, the entire staff is extremely friendly except for one lady. I have the feeling the rest of the staff there is compensating for her rudeness. She is so clearly not made for customer service and it never fails. I am writing this review because today was just that one extra sass I didn’t feel like dealing with in all honesty. Her attitude is incomprehensible, she will find any reason to start an argument or start a fight I feel. I have witnessed this with other customers as well so it can’t be a personal reason towards me. All in all this Canada post has the most helpful and friendly staff except for that elderly lady. And total side note, she will switch from English to French even though I am speaking English to her; she starts off with English but when she wants to get sassy she switches to French. I really wish she would get a different job where she has no contact with people, like stocking shelves or something."
,Nabeel Ali,1,Unreal that this place is allowed to function the way it is. 4 people behind the counter yet only 2 are serving customers while there’s a line of 15-20 people. 30 minutes wait time just to pick up a package? Absolutely unreal…..
,Richard Boivin,1,Old man who served me was extremely slow and rude during the whole process. Save yourself the headache and go somewhere else.
,strat19931,1,The lines are at least 20- 30 minutes due to slow semicompetant service. One person at the counter does not work...need 2 people at all times minimum. Customers should also try not to be idiots to speed thing along
,M F,5,Sharuyan was amazing. So patient and helped me with many packages. Great employee.
,Lea Tewfik,1,"Waited 45 minutes in line to make a few returns and got ""served"" by the rudest person I have ever seen."
,Rami brm,1,The customer service at this post is terrible. Adam was the agent in charge he was not respectful at all and shoot for no reason. I gave him a good lesson of respect and complaint on him online. Hope you guys at canada post improve your service. Adam should be returned home to learn how to communicate respectfully in the society before going to work. Adam should be fired.
,Megan Yang,1,"The staff kept rolling her eyeball and frowned at everybody for no reason.  She yelled to the poor guy to do things as what she asked. Then turned to me, give me your address. Then I asked don’t you have to measure my package before you type them in? She went what’s your problem!? I was like ****!?? As she was ignoring my asking, one of her colleagues came. And made a suggestion telling me it would be cheaper if I choose to use their prepaid box. Before I got the chance to respond, the lady yelled at him let me finish my work, don’t interrupt me. Then I brought my question out again. To everyone‘s surprise, she just left leaving me full of questions in my head!!! Don’t know what annoyed her.  While filling the address, I heard she yelled like you’re not the boss!Don’t talk to me! Apparently this is to her colleague who tried to start a conversation with her. The attitude is fantastic!"
,luojihencha WhyYouCare,1,"I should have writen a bad review last time. Because of high gas price I went this Canada post again. The staff keeps rolling her eyeball when you ask her simple question like what is the price for register mail.  And I only asked once. Don’t know why that annoyed her. The attitude is fantastic, fantastic eyeballs rolled"
,B.E.L,2,"I was waiting in the line patiently and was listening the guy (employee)repeating the same things second time to the customer front of me. The customer looked confused and sad because she came all the way to post her package and the guy was keep repeating her that he cannot take the package because she has to press the paper stronger so the letters on the copy would be visible. The customer was sad and “oh really”… He could simply tell her to re-write the paper on the table on the side, close to the counter. I involved and tried to explain her that she doesn’t have to go back home, she could write there.  The guy was disturbed and almost chewed me out, said “ madam take your time but wait for your turn please “ ! What an unkind dushbag! Instead of repeating same useless explanation, do something problem solving, I thought myself… However I could only said “I was trying to help sir”… Btw, there were 2-3 more customers waiting in line behind me. Slow and unkind service!"
,Loïc Yavercovski,5,"Went there for the first time since since the Canada post at Monk is closed… I went to send an international package and the Asian lady there helped me. I think it’s the first time I deal with à Canada post employee that is so nice, polite and willing to help that I decided to write a review."
,Hien and Huy Vu,1,"Bad service. A staff who worked on Friday ( July 21, 2023) is very rude, not friendly..."
,Jessica Wu,5,"I appreaciate the fact this post office have longer hours then other post offices. Once my package got sent to this location for pickup, I was super happy because it fit my busy daytime schedule.

The staffs are very helpful and they deserve my respect for their hardwork. Two weeks ago, I tried to go there find some limited edition stamps, although they have runned out of the stamps I was looking for, the staff tried to assist me as much she could. 😘"
,Jo M,5,"Really great service unlike a lot of other Canada Post counters in Montreal. Very fast and efficient lady who is extremely service minded. I have been there 3 times and was lucky to be attended to by the same spectacled, thin, short lady who is really nice. Don't know her name, but she is like a machine. Amazing!"
,Mouris Khouri,4,A very good Canada post branch. Place is clean and very well organized.  Employees are nice and you can see right away that they do their best in order to serve their clients better. Services fees are the same of course like any other branch but at least they offer a fast and reliable service. It's really a professional teams and good management
,CaCaDamz,1,"I can understand this place gets very busy with line ups... However, if I call and you answer, I'm no less a customer and do not need to be talked to in a rushed or rude manner. I might not be on the other side of the counter, but that doesn't mean you can't be helpful and rule out manners. The woman I spoke to flat out hung up on me. Wow! Grade A service..."
,Lauren Lin,5,"Fast service!
Droped by to return my WIFI modem today. I read the reviews and pretty worried it'll take too long, but its done in 5 minutes! There is a white young guy, sry i dont know his name, who is friendly and efficient!👍"
,fahime heydari,1,"Worst staff ever. I had to leave home 15 mind early to get my parcel sent before work but the guy in the counter was soooooo slow motion that I ended up leaving without getting my packages sent. Extremely incompetent staff. I guess they take a ""who hates working"" test before hiring these people. Incompetent incompetent incompetent"

,Emilia Lu,1,"Unbelievable attitude, everything worked out smoothly last time when I was picking up the package but this time the old lady refused to give me my package although I have my physical passport. Wonder if it’s due to any discrimination issue. Terrible service, I would rather return my package!

Went in again and asked for her name: Nikolai. Unlike her, the guy with glasses was very friendly."
,Guo Tang,1,"I paid over 130 dollars to sent a package and received discrimination from the staff! I wonder if my money will be used to pay those people for their food??? It’s not a good way to waste food though! This feeling is even worse than paying taxes!
Canada Post, Canada Worst!"
,Yixuan Li,1,"Zero star. This was the first time I came to this Canada Post location. The experience was awful! The front desk lady was soooo rude and threw my return packages on the floor, when she saw the customer she didn’t even say hi or a word! She seemed very angry about nothing. I didn’t remember her name, there were two staffs there, and the one treated me badly was an older Indian women. Canada post, please do something about this staff! Customers need to be treated nicely! Never come to this location again! Such a Shame!"
,Irena Ladna,1,Zero star!!! Worst service ever. Not friendly and rude woman. Agresive to customers.
,Hatem Megaly,1,"Below zero, the woman on the counter her name is Derola, aggressive, rude, impolite, arrogant.
Reported her to Canada Post and I WILL NOT LET IT GO.
How come with all the negative reviews here, they still keep her there.
Again, I WILL NOT LET HER GO WITH THE WAY SHE TREATED ME.
The worst place ever."
,bruh bruv,5,"I don't understand the negative reviews. Post Canada, a crown corporation, has a habit of making things complicated and the employees are aware of that. It's not worth getting frustrated at them.

However, if you would just listen properly, they can give you all the information you need and the process is super smooth and honestly quite pleasant.

The woman at the counter is the GOAT"
,siva ramakrishna,1,"This by far is the WORST Canada Post location I have ever come across. The staff have been rude and unprofessional. And it happened several times with different employees. So it definitely wasn't an issue with a particular individual. Their service is bad. I went to pick up something and the lady just said, computer isn't working and you can comeback in an hour. And when u called her after 2 minutes she said everything is working well.
I wish They weren't lazy and have empathy for customers"
,Jette Roma,1,"Update your hours! Such an incovenience. Google says you close at 9, you should abide by it! Arrived before 8 and it is already locked. Such a waste of time coming here."
,Marc Zehil,1,"Google says it closes at 9, I arrive at 7h50 and they say they're closed at 8h. Employes clearly don't want to work and try to get out early. Disgusting."
,Mando Rico,5,"I always get friendly and efficient service with Lisa. Wait times are usually tied to the volume of foreign money transfers made, and not postal operations. Avoid pay day and benefits evenings if at all possible."
,DEEPAK SHARMA,2,Too slow. Time consuming though successful results.
,Vincent Belhumeur,1,Adjust the hours on google maps as the store closes before 21h as indicated online...
,bayboy kg,1,Disgusting service by Alexandra the manager very arrogant. This canada post already has 2.8 stars .hope higher staff will notice and make some improvements.
,Sally M,3,"3/5 times there's an issue with my pickups... A couple of times the manager claimed I picked up my package, but thankfully the staff remembered me and told her I hadn't picked up that specific shipment. Another time they lost boxes and the manager was supposed to call me back - 2 weeks on and a couple of calls in between - I returned to be told they still hadn't found the boxes. I eventually got them, no comment... I have so many more examples of poor service unfortunately. This place can definitely be managed better! However, overall, the staff I land on have been nice and do their best with situations handed from what I've seen."
,Panteha Mamouri,1,"Generally, I am not a fan of this branch. The staff are VERY slow and undertrained. And it’s always a nightmare wanting to get your package from them. I was picking up a package one time and the lady couldn’t find it. She asked for my number to call me back whenever it was found, but never did. I had to go back a few days later and she said she forgot to look for it, but this time she just found the package in the back.

Though, one time we arrived 15 minutes before they close, and we had 5 boxes being shipped internationally. They stayed 20 minutes late just for us and processed all our packages for shipping. We are very thankful for that."
,SD,5,Patrick was the only one serving and he did hell of a job considering a massive line-up! Canada Post needs to deploy more workforce! One person working in the whole branch is not normal!
,Hossein,4,"Speaking of the staff at Canada Post, they are quick-handed and gracious when responding to customers. In addition, they do care about your delivery problems. A case in point is the time when it took just a bit long for my package to arrive for which one of the clerks working there described the procedure. He also provided me with a number to follow up on my postages.

The downside, however, is that there seems not to be two staff working there simultaneously all the time which makes  customer service a bit intolerable not only for the lonely clerk but also for customers to wait up in line.

All in all, I'm quite satisfied with the customer service provided at Canada post. I believe authorities could provide customers with seats to sit while waiting in line especially for the elderly people who are unable to be standing for even 10 straight minutes."
,Jacques Wang,1,"Very slow service, poor customer service
Employee was not available between 13:50 and 14:15 (I guess for lunch or smoke break?)
The staff being not present eems to be a recurrent problem"
,Alexandra Rupp,3,"The staff are good and friendly, but they seem very understaffed and the wait is often very long, especially if all you want to do it drop off a parcel that has a prepaid shipping label."
,sandip gadhiya,1,The employees don't know how to verify documents. They don't know what sorts of documents they have to check even if it's written on the documents.
,Jane FP,5,"Excellent service. Kind staff. I went on Tuesday night when it was very busy; yet, the service was still friendly and courteous."
,D C,2,There staff is often absent. Long lines.

,Arlina Hysi,1,"Very bad experience with the employee working there. Constantly made fun of me and offended me for not knowing how mailing works. After I left and did not even say a word to her , I heard her talking to one of her colleagues about me while they were both laughing. The worst experience I have ever had. The employees name is Whitney"
,Sunidhi Sunidhi,1,I went to jean coutu to print the document and I don’t know if there was a problem in the  machine or in my usb and the lady at the cashier sent someone to help me and the guy came and said I don’t even know how it works.

,Handeep kaur,5,The staff boy zakkery is very kind and helpful . Awsm service 👍👍👍
,Lisa Caplan,5,"Incredible service! I'm disabled and my medication comes by mail once or twice a week The folks at Roxboro go SO far out of their way to help me - they have located missing parcels, expedited deliveries, they have resent packages twice in one day - and they are just so kind and understanding. It's not often that anything that is a part of a governmental bureaucracy works at all, much less well enough to cater to a single individual's needs,, but thee guys get it spot on - I often feel I've traveled back to a nicer era when dealing with them - THANK YOU!!!"
,Emma najjar,1,"That's awful. Especially the two Chinese employees that they are. I want to freely write that the manager should train them again!
He gave me the cardboard glue and told me to glue the cartons yourself because it is yours and this was the first experience in my life that the post office employee is so rude and irresponsible!
Or the Chinese girl employee is very impatient and irresponsible. Because I live in this neighbourhood, I have to go and every time I see these two people, I return home disappointed and angry."
,D. W.,2,"Thought I got charged twice for one shipping envelope, asked the worker if they made a mistake. They denied it, and once I paid and got my receipt, I could confirm I was charged twice. Inattentive and sloppy. Expensive to mail a small package as always, inside Canada or to the US. Will try the UPS shipping on Notre Dame next time."
,Ekaterina E,1,12 o’clock on Sunday it is closed. On Google maps your working hours on Sunday are 09:00-17:00. I made my way from Île des sœurs to see that you are closed?!
,Jeannie Lee,2,"The red hair lady at the desk will find a reason not to send your package and when she does, she’ll give you a big smirk. The rest of the staff are great."
,Semeon Arthamonov,4,"Ever since the working hours were reduced, you have to wait in a noticable line. Otherwise, great place with a very friendly staff."
,Adam Dadoun,2,Staff is super friendly. A gentleman helped me with the self serve machine... there was one big package that could not fit in so I waited in line. 2 persons in front left and lost patience. The lady at the cash is very slow and i think the man that helped me was on break but still... you are expected to postpone your break when it gets packed..  everyone is frustrated in the line. More staff should work there on weekends since this is when people are not working or in school and actually go to the post office .. 😒
,Raiden Yvelina,5,"Never waited more than 5 minutes and staff is very competent! If you are in a rush perhaps don’t go during rush hour, or have your parcels delivered to a less central location 🙂"
,Alexander Peplowski,4,"There's usually a line around rush hour, but aside from that I've never had a problem picking up a package here"
,Amy Tang,1,"Service so slow that makes me never want to go get my package. Very disorganized and really horrible service. They close at 5 but in reality closes at 4:45 because of their lazy, slow and inefficient staff. Worst post Can I’ve ever been to."
,Lucas Lacerda,5,"Staff was very helpful every time I needed to go there. Fast, friendly and efficient service :)"
,Louis Jezsik,4,"One of the few actual post offices in the town. You are more likely to be served more quickly here than in the drug store post offices. Friendly staff. Avoid showing up just before closing! Local merchants tend to arrive at the end of the day, laden with parcels to send out."
,Jacky V.,5,Good old fashioned post office. I hope this one stays open. The line ups are shorter than at pharmacies and the staff seem more experienced.
,Jessica Wu,5,"I came here to send first letter of my lifetime, and, WOW, in a blink of the eye the staff was already done with stamping and doing her work.

In this experience, a single stamp is 1.07 cent before tax (to post within Canada). After this, it inspired me to buy some of their limited edition permanent stamps...🤣maybe they will become incredibly valuable when I get old (I said maayybe). But I bought them online as other greedy people bought all the in-store limited edition I was looking for."
,Florencia Flow,1,"I went a month ago, due to the pandemic it had signs reminding you to stay two metres apart.
A man started verbally attacking me when I kindly told him he was too close by making a gesture with my hand. He called me all kind of names while I was saying I just wanted to send my letter and leave.
It was a disaster,  the three women who are employees didn't help me, didn't say a word and they didn't care for all the insults, there was no security and no one called anyone. I was openly being insulted by a man unfairly.
You need security or you need to teach your employees to be helpful."
,Icarus Fx,1,"Disgusting behavior! My wife went there to mail a letter to the US. Not knowing any better, she was initially trying to use a US Postage stamp. The worker told her it was not valid but then began to laugh at her and mock her by making degrading comments to humiliate her. When she went to leave, she realized it was not right and got upset. She asked him for his name and he replied ""Tony Baloney"" and would not call or let her talk to a manager."
,Donka,2,"Empty counter with two person behind it  :)  Very rude young lady, forcing herself to be polite ! She wasn't very helpful. So I went on the other side of Decarie, way better but of course crowed as usual."

,Jacklyn Leonard-Bourdages,1,"The lady working last night has 0 customer service skills. Saying “Yup” to call the next customer, belittling customers because they were having trouble understanding her, throwing a box into the back storage area, slamming things on counter. I’m pretty sure my shipping was already included with my return but I paid anyways because I didn’t want her to make me feel stupid. I understand that we need to be patient since finding and hiring staff is difficult these days, however, this was unacceptable."
,Flavio Das Chagas Dias,5,Very friendly and professional staff.

,wongi C,1,"I don't understand why there are people at the counter who look tired and don't want to work. Very very slow and rude and passing my things by pushing her feet. I've been in a bad mood here at the office many times, but today was the worst.

If Canada Post insists that it's okay to be rude because the clerk is old and female, I'll forget what happened today.

One more here, a few months ago, my wife went to pick up something in the evening with a delivery notice, but after 20 minutes, she just came out empty-handed. When I asked why she was empty-handed, the clerk said she was busy and didn't have time to take care of her parcel, so the clerk told her to just go. My wife was almost in tears..... I went into the office upset and tried to ask the clerk what was going on. When the office clerk saw that my wife showed up with me, she immediately took care of the delivery notice and picked up the package in the back room. I've had a few more bad experiences with them, but I'll stop for today. My conclusion is Canada Post is rude, slow and lazy."
,griffin quigley,1,Today I went to this Canada post location as it was the closest to me while doing a work visit. This was my first time dealing with this location. I and an frequent customer so I expected my transaction to be easy just like the others well Boy was I wrong. I waited 20 minutes for the post office clerk to finish a transaction for a single stamp to the US. When I got up I asked for all my items to be sent lettermail 13 to be exact. She created the oversized mail labels and I paid for the transaction. She then told me that I had to place the labels on the parcels and I told her that was her job to do. She argued back at me during this time and I just did it to ensure that my items had the correct label on them I then realized she charged me 2 extra labels and told me that if I wanted a refund that she would have to cancel my whole transaction. She was very rude and I shouldn’t be doing her job. I would not recommend this location and hope that the customer service gets a big improvement
,Viki LI,1,Worst delivery and pick up service ever. My item was sent to the wrong location and I had to pick it up by my own….
,Woo Choi,1,"I sent my parcel (suitcase) from this location to Ontario at July 23 by Monica. I felt the person is look tired and work loosley and vacantly. and the item is not available to track since August 5, and status shows the item is still in Halifax. Do they sent my parcel on right way?  I spent my time and effort to find my parcel and submit investigation tickets via CP for a month but CP closed the issue. it was suitcase contains over $400 values stuff. I lost my package with no reason."
,Mike _,1,"Extremely inexperienced staff. The lady with post office manager name tag unable to print labels and blamed it on customer. Offers no resolution at all.

Use Almon St location if you can."
,V. Philendra,5,"Had a false customs charge on a package from Korea and Haliey encouraged me to send it for a re-evaluation, helped me with the forms, and I was back in today after a month getting my package released for free (as it should be because the shipping was already paid for in Korea while sending). Thanks to Hailey I didn't lose $40+, she absolutely deserves a raise!"
,Syameena Pillai,5,Gone to this location numerous times to return and pick up packages. All the staff have been extremely friendly and helpful. It's well organized and fast-moving. No issues at this location. Would highly recommend!
,Maxine Rudy,5,"I have always found the staff at this post office to be helpful, courteous and efficient!"
,Joseph Brooks,5,"I had to check the hours on google before going and noticed all the negative reviews. I was surprised since Ive gone to this location numerous times and never noticed anything negative. All these negative reviews about someone named Scott and so I couldnt help but notice that it was exactly Scott who was working when I went in today. He was perfectly polite and helped me with what I needed. I even was unintentionally a bit annoying as a customer and he still helped me with no rudeness or anything. I guess if you expect the red carpet laid out for you and a shoulder massage at the post office, and Scott doesnt do that for you, then you're bound to get upset and leave a negative review. But yeah there is really nothing to complain about at this place."
,Kenneth Carmichael,4,Decent little Post Office in the south end. This location has extended hours including on Sunday so it is more convenient than others. I’ve never had to wait long in the line up here as the staff seem to know what they are doing. They have a small collection of collectible stamps and First Day Covers as well. Many of these kiosks do not.
,Alisha Vidito,1,"Usually an okay post office location.  However, a few months ago, there was someone by the name of Stephanie working.  She was quite snippy and rude to me.  I asked her approximate times for different shipping options and she was abrupt/snippy: ""I have no idea! We can't predict anything"". An appropriate response could have been:  ""we are experiencing trouble with estimating times for deliveries because of xyz factors. Sorry about that, I wish I could be more accurate for you"".  Stephanie needs to improve her customer service! I left there extremely irritated and I will no longer recommend this location."
,Ting Li,1,"On Google and their location both show working hours until 2100(9pm), but I went the post office 6pm, they already closed. They should update the working hours properly."
,Bonnie Chiasson,1,"I know there are challenges in the delivery services and one has to allow a bit of delay for that under the circumstances.
However, knowing that your parcel from AMAZON has been sitting idle at this Halifax Central Station for 5, 6, 10 days is infuriating and frustrating. AMAZON has already refunded the value of two packages to me because of LATE DELIVERY!!! One package was valued at $69.19 and the other was $46.77.
How can this possibly happen?  Other delivery services have adapted to the current COVID-19 workplace changes. This has been going on for over a year after all. You should have adapted more effectively by now or you should just throw in the towel.
Most other delivery services manage to get their packages delivered on time and, in most cases, a day or two early.
Not only is this Halifax Central Station costing AMAZON a LOT of money, they are also a huge blemish for Canada Post.
Currently I am waiting for a package that has been in Halifax since March 23rd...it is now March 28th.  Their tracking site says it Now is rescheduled to arrive on March 30th.....it was due March 25th. AMAZON just sent me a message advising that I qualify for a refund due to late delivery.....AGAIN !!!!!
CAN ANYONE TELL ME WHY THIS IS HAPPENING OVER AND OVER AGAIN!!!!
Get your business in order HALIFAX!!"
,R E,5,"Note it's closed 24-26 Dec, 31 Dec- 1 Jan. This is the ONLY Shopper's with a photo lab for passports and official documents etc, as well as a post office. They're both inside the Shopper's but know that Canada Post had different hours."
,michele smith,1,They are supposed to be open till 9pm today. I needed 3 stamps had to buy a book of 10 because the postal outlet was closed.
,Grace Cowan,1,"Instead of updating their hours online like a professional business, they put up a sign, so I walked all the way to this post office to discover that they were closed. This was New Years Eve (a Friday), so I get that they’re also closed on New Years Day (Saturday), but I was informed that they’re also closed on Sundays, which is incredibly frustrating. Not only does this mean that I can’t pick up my package for 3 extra days, but I needed something out of the package for someone that was supposed to be leaving on the Sunday, and now can’t leave because we were unable to pick up the package. The front clerk that I called afterward to ask if there was really no way I could just pick up my package was unpleasant and unhelpful, all she said was that they would be open on Monday. Waste of my time and my friends money, because now they have to reschedule their entire transportation situation. And I could have collected it yesterday had they updated their information online and not given the impression that they would be open. Not impressed."
,S B (Strongbeans),1,"Needs to update their hours online.
Also their signs in store are also confusing for hours of business"
,John Knowles,1,"Girlfriend was overcharged, by 10+ dollars, and they weren't able to refund her for like 30 minutes. If you value your time, avoid this post office at all costs."
,MJ Seager,5,The ladies who work here always go above and beyond. Service with a smile and extremely understanding. I was very late to pick up a parcel and it was held there for me beyond my given days. I appreciate them! Thank you!
,Koustav Pain,5,"Been there twice, great experience both times. Really helpful"
,M Dambergs,1,"Closed at 6 due to COVID-19. Why aren’t the hours updated? I assume because the Lawton’s staff prefer to harass people who come by after 6 and are confused and upset, as they did to me when they prevented me from picking up a package that contained my medication.

If you don’t like having people call the cops on you for crying, don’t use this location."
,Asif Zarin,5,"I was assisted by Kimberly martin.
Very helpful and friendly lady.
She guide me very professional way."
,J Mac,5,"Angela is the best in the business. Always a pleasure to deal with, very professional and extremely helpful. Thanks for everything Angela, you are the main reason I do business with this Canada Post location!"
,Juliano Ferrari,1,"This is NOT directed to this location by any means but to the whole Canada post failing corporate. Since the last strike you had your service became terrible, I ran my business for decades by sending cheque’s via Mail. Now it’s 3 to 1 every three times they get it out once to desired destination. It’s effecting my reputation as a business owner.
Shame on you. Get enough man power out there or simply shut the operating Down."
,L. Y.,5,"Angela is her name and she is an angel
Saturday afternoon, She went beyond and above her way to help me reorganize the boxes, seal them back tight and ship them.
Thank you Angela, Canada post should be proud of having someone like you working with them. Kudos"
,taylor perry,5,"This is my regular post office and despite bringing 50-100+ packages there every time, the two main ladies are the sweetest and nicest people! They scan all my packages very quickly and i’ve never felt like they were irritated or annoying about having to do it!(like other locations ive been too). They’re so nice and make conversation about my business and i enjoy chatting with them while I wait! I remind them how awesome they are everytime! Thank you for your hard work everyday!!!🥰"
,Frank Wormald,3,Slow service. It's often busy with one clerk so allow 10-15 min.
,Shaul Byunghyun Go,5,kind and helpful staff. happy every time I drop by.
,Ayodeji Arowolo,5,"A lady served me today February 10, 2021 about 15:00hours and I must say that was excellent customer service! She was very helpful and polite and if I were a mystery shopper she'd score a straight 100%😃. Thank you very much."
,Rmie Rxs,5,"I came to post two parcels the other one international, I did not realize for the customs document, they do not really give you the paper form option anymore, instead it has to be done on line, anywho, not that I am making an excuse I am really busy with my chore, two children, work and other duties that I am always running, at Bayers Road Canada Post a year ago the staff at Canada Post gave me a $**t with this exact issue, I forgot to do the thing online, and I only have 10 minutes of window that day as I needed to return to my work,  Edie on the other hand (of Canada Post Larrry Uteck, 15th of October, approximately 1530) despite the line up, and because for some reason the scan won't work I kind of expected she would snap to me and judge me why I did not or was not able to do this on line, instead she said let me try to do it here manually for you, Edie thank you, you made my day, again I was on a hurry that Friday afternoon, and have not eaten anything and have to ran chores, but you took and help me accomplish one of my errands which is to finally send of these parcels, thank you for your kindness, patience we need more of this kindness especially these trying times"
,Ms. B,5,"Everytime I go into here the ladies are so nice. Always helpful. I mailed a parcel the other day on Saturday, we had a hard time with the process but the lady was very patient with me as was I with her. We finally got the job done. Great experience!"
,Manpreet K,1,"RUDE STAFF I never had an issue there before but this time it but kind of racist behaviour i felt there...
I was there on Feb 17 around 6:30-7:00 that CSR I know she is new there as i am regular customer but she doesn’t know how to talk and respond to customers..NO CUSTOMER SERVICE AT ALL... It was not only me that felt that but there was another girl as well she felt same way.. she only talk nicely if you are blonde breaks my heart. (She asked me to bring my lease paper as my NS license is not enough)
I will never go back to that location ever again
Used to be my favourite one"
,Carla Wright,5,"Amazing service from these ladies every time i go in there.  Always friendly and helpful.  Cannot say enough about these gems...  I take all my postal needs to them.  Julie, Pam and Colleen are awesome."
,Mervat Ahmad,1,"very rude Woman, her name's Colleen , she shouldn't be working in customer service she treat the people like garbage and she doesn't respect any of the people who were on line ,,,, i shouldn't put any star to this review"
,MALEK BADOUR,1,"The lady who works there ,her name is colleen and she's  very rude an she shouldn't be working there  very very bad customer service and bad attitude"
,Grant的加拿大笔记,1,"I took rerun label. The staff didn’t want to do anything about the package, just asked me to use the tape to seal envelope and put the label sticker on it. Thanks for training me! Maybe that’s their policy to teach customer how to self service?uh…or they don’t want to take any responsibility about packing if there’s something wrong with broken item, so they just want you to do everything and they just accept it what it is and deliver. It’s interesting service"
,Antony Fu,5,"Always like to come to this CP since moved to nearby community. Less busy than the one at Lacewood. The staffs here always have smile on their faces and always, always very patient.

I happen to be greeted by Kevin many times for afternoon visits. He is particularly informative and efficient, guiding me to the right type of service I need and save my time and money!"
,Corey Saunders,3,"Been my local post office for a couple of years now, and it's generally a normal post office experience. However, I went there yesterday evening to pick up and also send a package. I merely asked a pretty basic, nonchalant question (address/identification related) about another shipping service and the young woman curtly replied ""I don't know, I don't work for them."" Thanks, I knew that. After signing for my package on the touchscreen I forgot to press 'OK' and tried to press it with my finger and she basically yelled at me to use the pen. She might be the most unpleasant person I've dealt with as a customer in years. I know it's a government job and customer relations isn't priority one but she was just outright rude."
,Ghost Buster,1,"They won’t even print labels for returns. I had to go staples and spend $2-$3 trying to print the labels. I couldn’t get the labels to print. So I had to cancel the cancelation and send through ups. CP you give terrible service. Your packages take weeks to arrive, where every other courier service takes 2-3 days. Spent a couple of hours just trying to process returns."
,Nate Sutton,4,Store is located at the back of the Guardian. Staff have always been friendly and helpful. The biggest problem is there is only one person manning it that ive seen. This place can sometimes get busy and ive been stood waiting for 30 minutes + before. Other than that good.
,Anna Brozek,4,"Good service most of the time!!! I drop off packages every few days and most of the staff are really nice and always get to work scanning my parcels right away. There's just an employee or two that I have to ask for service. But overall really nice place. They have a bunch of supplies for packaging there too, if you're short on time. Just a tip though, you can find boxes for about half the price at a dollar store! Same with the bubble mailers."
,Nigel Thorpe,5,Situated in Shoppers Drug Mart. Friendly staff.
,Johnny Chronic,5,Friendly staff :)
,Scarlet Dean-Moore,5,
,Fran A,1,"Please stay out of this Canadapost as they are ridiculous! I came here with my return package and they rejected it as it’s too complicated for them or someone is too lazy to try to help or figure it out.

I had 3 items from the same shipper on Amazon. On the label it said 3! Items but they gave ridiculous excuse… oh you need 2 other different labels.  And I’m like they all came together.
Going back and forth just for one of them to tell her colleague “oh manager said we shouldn’t accept these items”.

And I’m just like you guys should have just said you’re too lazy to return my items than giving me silly excuses!"
,Ev McCrea,5,Stephanie is the best she helped me out with everything from stamps to packages she is the best. I just want to say this because this post office seem really under rated.
,Reggie Sutton,5,Maria was very kind and helpful!
,Meizheng Tong,5,The lady is kind and extremely helpful 😊
,canchooc,1,"Lucky if they even go in your driveway before listing the package as ""attempted to deliver"""
,Graeme Lipford,1,"Went through 3 employees - nobody knows what Snap Ship is? I’ve been shipping here twice a week since dec 2019, take 2 months off of shipping and now suddenly nobody working there knows how to scan a QR code and print a shipping label- saying they’ve never heard of snap ship.

Like going to McDonald’s and being told sorry sir, we don’t know what French fries are, are you sure you’ve ordered them here before?

Ridiculous"
,Monique MacKenzie,5,I had excellent service last night. The young man was very efficient. He had a pile of parcels to tend to but was very patient with me.
,Michelle Dyke,3,"Had a bit of a wait, not too long."
,Manpreet K,5,They have best staff as compared to any other location of Canada post 👍🏻 I feel confident and always come back with smile just because of their great customer service
,shirley haynes,5,Always good service
,Tom Cao,1,"They don't even provide tape, you need to buy it yourself"
,Dan Nordoff,4,I've always had great customer service here.  Pleasant staff and professional service. It can be busy sometimes though because of its central location.
,Ryan O'Toole,1,"Rhonda is the absolute rudest person I've dealt with in a long time. Every time, too, without fail."
,Corey Grandy,3,Supervisor could use a lesson in customer service and being a pleasant person from her much nicer employees.
,Qasem,1,Different than other Canada Post locations! It seems like it's privately run. Workers are usually slow and inefficient. They charge higher taxes on mail than other locations!
,Jason Smith,1,Item was delivered to my house but I had to sign for it. When I went to sign for it the driver said he made a mistake and I would have to go to the post office after 6pm and pick it up there. He literally took the package back from my hands.  I drove to the post office for 7pm (it closes at 8pm) only to be told by Superstore staff that they are understaffed and needed to pull people from the Post Office to man the Superstore.
,R K,1,"Only gave it one star because zero was not an option. The people here used to be half nice, but the woman behind the counter now is the most rude and sarcastic publicly-funded loafer I've ever dealt with. Repeated mistakes on my packages were backed up with arrogant defiance about how ""hard-working"" CP staff were, which is not terribly evident in the cow-gazing-over-a-fence performance in this location. I now drive the extra distance to go to a real Post Office."
,Simon Gagne,3,"I normally don't have any bad comment about this location, but today, the employee deserved a 0.01 star. She was so angry that i didn't have a postal code on my package. I was scare she would jump over the counter in rage and use her tape gun to put me in a box an return me to sender."
,Ashlan Potts,4,"We love how convenient this location is, as we can drop off mail or pickup postage whenever we do our groceries. We've never had an issue with the opening hours, but we are also nearly always there at the same time. They have plenty of packaging and postage options, packing supplies, gifts and memorabilia, as well as a national and international mailbox on site. The staff is usually always excellent, although our favourite person seems to have left. My only suggestion is to have more staff on during busy times. I know they have more to do than just accepting mail, but sometimes if they don't see you at the front it can be challenging to get their attention."
,Richard Martin,2,"Today I was left a key for one of the compartments for packages.  When I open it there was nothing in it.  I am sure it was in the other compartment because it would have been to large to fit in the one he left me the key for.  Everyone can make a mistake, but two weeks age I got the key for another package.  When I open the compartment it was for someone else.  A neighbor down the road stop by because the postman had left her a key for the my package.  The I he left the key for me to open was for her neighbor who didn't get any key.  I don't think this is just a mistake, it's being careless in you job."
,Jason,5,"Attention: this post office is not open to the General Public, it in located inside CFB Halifax and requires a Department National Defense (DND) Identification Card to access this part of the base.

This post office has friendly staff and the location is very clean."
,Phil Mabley,1,
,Joe Cheng (joeFNcheng),5,
,K,1,
,Travis Whalen,5,"The staff was nice enough. There is no outdoor signing showing where this post office is so if you don't normally live around here or shop at the Atlantic Superstore, it can be tough to find. I found it after feeling lost for a little bit.

Long story short it's in the Atlantic Superstore near the NSLC and directly down the area to the left when you walk in the doors. Near the cash registers."
,Lisa Butt,5,I had the privilege of using this facility for 10 months for my business needs. Staff was always very professional and helpful. Thank you kindly from Lisa at Oceanview Quilt.
,Cory Sampson,2,Staff working was very dull. Had no drive to even be working there.
,Ryan Boots,1,
,Jaswinder Singh,1,
,Cara O'Leary,1,Says post office is open until 9pm and the store itself closed at 8pm. UPDATE YOUR HOURS ONLINE. what a waste of my time and gas money!
,Mike Sweetman,5,Great little post office 👍
,Alireza Siadat,5,Super friendly and caring staff. Have used this place three times and never got disappointed! They guide you very well. I’ve been getting good service here so far.
,J M,1,"Postman never attempts delivery (a frustration in itself), so I have to deal with the very rude man that works the counter. One time there was a woman working in his place and she was so much friendlier. The one star is for her."
,Alexander Howlett,1,"Got in line before they closed, but said that by the time they were done with what they were doing they would be closed and wouldn't be able to help me or the other person in line. Absolutely ridiculous"
,Darshi Patel,1,"I had a very bad experience with this location.
They mentioned the closing time 7:00PM. Thought I went there on 6:50PM and they said they can’t take my parcel and the store is closing 15mins early every day. So if you’re closing at 6:45PM you guys need to update the time on google."
,Sidney Hamilton,1,"This is nothing against this specific Canada Post. Just Canada Post in general. They are terrible and can never manage to deliver a parcel on time. How can some random person in a rundown mini van or sedan manage to deliver packages faster and in better condition than our national mail service with unionized workers? Also how is this company still allowed to sell priority and express post when they can't even guarantee what time it will get there? If a private company did this, it would be considered fraud."
,Justin Laing,1,"Canada post website, as well as Google, clearly state this location is open until 7pm. I showed up at 6:47pm and after standing at the counter for 5 mins, the worker, who saw me standing there for the 5 mins, said the location closes at 6:45pm. Umm, no, it doesn't as that's not posted anywhere. I wasted my time and gas driving there for nothing. This location needs all new employees."
,Brooklyn Aldo,1,"Google says open until 6:00pm on sunday, i’m here at 5:28pm and all the doors are locked."
,T K,1,Internet says open till 6 on Sunday.  I am here now at 5:25 and it is closed????
,Amanda Chiong,4,"I'm moving and shipped quite a few fairly large boxes through CanadaPost at this location. The person who helped me at the counter was perfectly fine, and the process went smoothly. They let me borrow a cart to bring the boxes inside as well. I did notice that the other person working and helping the other customers seemed to be a little less polite, but not so much that it was offputting."
,Maxwell Veer,1,"Is the requirement for working here to be extremely rude for no apparent reason? Imagine being a mailman and also being condescending, hilarious"
,Kendra Gorveatt,5,"I just sent Christmas gifts home to Ontario. Steve was extremely efficient and kind, assuring me that the parcel would be there in four business days.  I have had some bad experiences with FedEx and UPS and it is so nice to go to a Canada Post office and get good customer service and the assurance that your parcel will be handled with care. This location also has a great social distance policy of only three in the store at a time, and you can wait outside until it is your turn to go in."
,slade,1,Worst sourting facility for all canada post in all of Canada and they know it and could care less.
,Dave D,1,"When my  $3000 parcel tracking says it out for delivery by end of day on Thursday, then when it doesn't turn up and I check the tracking again on Friday and it says "" due for delivery on Tuesday"" you get one star because I can't give you none, Muppets."
,janet crozier,5,The staff at this location are always very friendly and efficient. They are also very knowledgeable regarding systems and protocols. There is rarely any wait time at this location.
,StuffedWithMuffins,5,Wonderful staff. Extremely efficient and helpful.
,Joe Blackmore,2,
,Todd Weber,1,"I went in to return a modem to our ISP using a return Id + auth number and the manager in training behind the counter looked at her screen for 30 seconds and asked if we had a barcode, when we said no she said “It only asks me for a bar code, sorry thats the best I c an do” and told us to come back at 1pm when someone else would be there. Went down the road to the Canada Post on Sackville drive and the young gentleman there had our package processed in under a minute when given the exact same information."
,PRABH,5,
,chris Hall,1,
,Keith Ver,5,"Very courteous and fast service! The staff are nice and will gladly accommodate your queries!

Just a tip tho, when you get a delivery notice, make sure to call them first before you go there. Sometimes your package might not be with them yet so it pays to check first."
,Jooye kwok,5,"Love this Canada Post location - every time I have been here, I have been helped thoroughly. I had to call in one time to ask one of the staff members to look up something manually for me (essentially, she had to go through a long list of transactions to find mine), and not only was the staff member successful in finding what I needed, she was SO friendly. Despite the location getting really busy at times with customers, the staff members are so efficient and friendly. Highly recommend!"
,Andreas Lerch,2,Honestly I wouldn’t have given 2 stars if the teller didn’t give me a hard time about giving me a piece of tape to attach the packing label to the parcel. I realize this is not a free for all packing service. My parcel was packaged all I needed was a piece of tape to attach the shipping label to the package. Not a big deal I already paid 28$ to ship it. Please pick and choose your tape battles. I would totally have understood if I was trying to wrap a whole package up. Rant over.
,Md Shohel RanaXp,1,I'm sorry say that deliver person didn't call me for home delivery. He just give a notice card to collect it from post office wich was far away from my home. It took my 2 hrs of valuable time and Taxi took me $24. It could have solved on the 1st day just giving a min phone call. :(
,Steve gobbo,5,"Good fast service, regardless who is working behind to counter.  I go there too many times, but they seem to be ok with me.   Darcy is the best!"
,Mei owo,1,"I’ve been going here alot because it is in the neighbourhoods. The women that work here has no respect and manners. I can’t understand why they speak and treat customers in such aggressive tone. (As if we are filthy) They cant seem to know how to interact with customer’s in respectful manners.

Whenever I go drop off a package. I always speak in low tone and respectful. In exchange they confront with aggressive, rude attitude. It make me uncomfortable to speak. The workers here has no customer skills and unprofessional. I would recommend to avoid this place."
,Patrick Maberry,1,"I was here today and the lady working didn’t had any compassion. They refused to give me my packages. They told me my ID was expired, and who knew photo ID’s even expired. I was nice and show them my student ID, name on Credit Card, and even a photo of my passport on my phone to make sure they knew it was me. They still refused telling me it was company policy. I understand policy but some people need to have compassion and make one time exceptions for good customer service.

Driver should had deliver on my door tho, but they decided to drop here."
,M M,1,The woman who works at the post office is SO RUDE and UNKIND and NO CUSTOMER SERVISE SKILL what soever. I forgot to check her name but she always BOSSY and RUDE  I normally avoid this post office because she makes me soo uncomfortable. She should not be working if she doesnt know how to treat customers.
,Anna Rebodos,5,I brought in 2 packages to be sent to the US at 8 a.m. today. The postal clerk on duty was extremely helpful. I am a senior and the least bit tech savvy. She assisted me in filling up the customs forms and gave me tips on reducing postal charges. I am in awe of how amazing she was.
,Laura Kittar,1,"If I could rate zero stars I would. The women who work at Canada Post are absolutely sour and miserable. Unwilling to assist, combative when you ask them questions, and overall just a horrible customer service experience. I had a large package to pick up - that Canada post didn’t even attempt to drop off at my house (I was home all day) - and the staff were rude and unhelpful in the process of pick up. Skip this location unless you want your day ruined."
,Stephanie Woods,5,The man that helped me sort out mail forwarding after my mom passed was so patient and kind. I have always had friendly service here!
,Zareef Houston,5,Best customer service out of Canada post that I've been to. William and his co-workers rock!
,PAWAN MADANKAR,1,"Rude, unhelpful staff couldn't figure out how to print out a shipping label , take long lunch breaks as customers to wait , never saw such service anywhere really horrible"
,Angela Y,1,"Came in on a Sunday and hours of operation state they're open until 5PM. I came in at 4:30PM and they already had the gates closed. The clerk said she was closed for the day. I understand if I came in at 4:50, but you still have half an hour before your posted closing time. Updating your hours would be greatly appreciated to save people an unnecessary trip."
,basedomg,5,The guy that works afternoons there is a legend. Can’t remember his name but he’s featured in the photos above. He’s extremely knowledgeable and efficient and just an all around beauty.
,Nyuri A,5,"I just had one of the best experiences at Canada Post. The male officer (I think his first name starts with J and T for his last name? He looked like Keir Gilchrist anyways) was so helpful and nice to not just me, to every single customer, obviously. Thanks to him, my first online shipping went smoothly. I hope there's always an offer like him at every Canada Post lol"
,India M. Clamp,3,"Review in progress...
At first I stopped at the liquor store as the location was somewhat unclear. In California most post offices are stand alone locations (Canada Post located inside a retail store) what a nice surprise.

Nice to meet you today Zenny. I appreciate the help in learning all about Canada Post. The two kind offerings are appreciated/unexpected. Liked the ""We do not Rush in Canada"" quote.

I was advised as to how long it would take for items to arrive and it was communicated how to properly address  (given end destination). Letters posted and anticipating the response."
,Nick Wimpney,1,"They refused to give me a package with our company name on it without a business card as ID.  I went back to the office and got a business card from the office manager, but then they refused to give it to me because my drivers license doesn't match the business card (because business cards are ID, right?)

This isn't ""signature required"", or ""Delivery only to the recipient"".  They usually just leave them in our lobby where anyone walking by could steal them, but then today we've got to jump through hoops to get our package."
,Ray Abedin,5,"Hi I have 2 post cards I sent out on March 13 but didn't write the addresses can you please contact me if you still have them, I can provide address"
,Mikau Seafox,1,"Canada Post has twice returned a parcel to the sender that I had ordered weeks ago on the basis that my apartment in Surrey is an ""invalid address"". I had been living in the same apartment for 5 years, and someone I live with has been receiving parcels from them and Purolator with far less issues than mine. Quite possibly the worse postal service in the country, bar none."
,Cora Penaflorida,1,"I was in this outlet yesterday, June 04 at 4:35PM. I was the 4th person in line. At 4:46, the store clerk said that she is closing. I was next in line. I told her why she did not announce it. She claims that she did. I was mailing something that requires a tracking number, Just as I was about to leave, the person behind me said that she is just there to pick up something. The store clerk said yes to her. What is the difference with serving a customer mailing a letter vs a customer picking up something.
I never minded the long line at this outlet but the kind of service given yesterday was UNACCEPTABLE.
People come to this outlet because it is the only one in the area. I hope another outlet opens in the area so that less people would come to this outlet.
I put ONE STAR but this outlet deserves ZERO STAR"
,Whitney Bee,5,"As a small business, I’m always at Canada Post shipping out parcels.

I’ve tried many locations but the staff at this location are extremely fast and efficient even when there’s always a line up here during peak times. Every single Canada Post staff member here is professional and patient when you need to ask them a question.

They don’t overcharge packages and usually provides a solution for you to save money unlike some Canada Post outlets."
,Jana Evans,5,"Best post office employees ever. Last night the guy there, not sure what his name is, has a light beard helped a lot to send my package the cheapest way. The post office was busy but he was multitasking helping me and serving other customer in a meantime while I was packing my stuff or filling up the form. He was very friendly, efficient and fast. Honestly I am buying him a gift card next time."
,Hannah taki,1,"Most of staff members seem to provide amazing customer services.
But unfortunately one of member who is a middle age lady and has Chinese accent might need some kind of trainings of customer service.
Her way of saying is a kind of tricky and sounds quite rude."
,Praveen Pious,5,Visited this place to send two mails to USA. The employee was courteous and helped me send the mails. I didn't have any spare envelops with me but the employee loaned me two envelopes for a nominal rate. Wanted tracking to be included in the mail and it was also done without any issues. Thank you for the wonderful service.
,Maria W,3,"I’ve been going here for like a decade and it’s been pretty mediocre in service. There was a short older Asian lady at the counter working mornings who always seemed to be in a bad mood and whenever I asked her anything she would basically shout back the answer at me like I was stupid. The older Asian man hasn’t been that rude to me, but he’s just really slow and seems kind of miserable. Haven’t had any trouble with any of the other staff, but the evening people seem to sometimes take their lunch without someone to cover for them, and leave a sign up “will be back in 30 minutes”. Not sure if she still works there but there was one young lady who was excellent with customers. White lady with brown hair. Super nice and super helpful when you had a problem. There were a couple times that I went in the next business day after 1 pm to get my package and it wasn’t at the post office yet. I would recommend going 2 or 3 business days after receiving your door knocker, just to be sure."
,Cindy Tang,4,"The staff is professional. I usually just drop off package there, so they process it really fast. However there is always a long line and the customers before me always take extremely long time. Since there is social distance measures and people have mask required so I don’t mind that much wait inline :)"
,レーレーヴィ,1,"Worst location.
Employees could take a course in customer service.
Staff is condescending and rude.
They outright blame Canada Post about their notification showing that packages are ready for pick up being fake and should wait a day or until you get a reminder.

How lazy is that when you see them have no customers and a pile of packages to scan in, they’re instead standing around gossiping.

Do a full circle of Shoppers to not interrupt them and nope, they’re still gossiping and get mad at you for interrupting.

The senior Asian lady with the long wavy hair is the worst."
,Randy MacPhee,5,"A lot of people say this location is really bad. Just went here today, the lady working, Padma, was great! Quick, friendly, and professional."
,Julia Penwarden,5,"I attended this RPO yesterday to do a Telus return…no return label or instructions from Telus!  Clerk took the parcel, printed a label, gave me a receipt with the tracking number (which he explained) and told me to have a good day!"
,Nicky Lee,5,Great customer service. Nice clean place. It's an official Canada post office. Hours are better than other ones.
,B L,1,"Worst customer service ever! I’ve been here many time, never had a good experience"
,Kay X,1,The Chinese lady working on Sundays do not know how to multitask. Told me that they do not allow drop offs and asked me to go back of the line and then had the customers become outraged?! All postal offices allow prepaid drop offs. All you need to do is scan them when you have the chance.
,Ali Farokhi,1,"The employe in this branch played with me . I paid 50 dollars for overnight service to toronto and my document didnt arrived yet. It has been 3 days. I have a container in delta port which I needed to release . Now 3 days equall to 600 dollars late pick up . I am not sure who is going to be responsible for my damage.  This is the worse service I have ever seen .
Dont go there . They play with you ."
,Katherine Scrimshaw,1,"The service is wildly unreliable. I've been there several times when no one was manning the counter. On three occasions I was told the person who was supposed to be working didn't show up. Many, many times I've stood in a long line up for 20 minutes waiting for someone to get off a break. I only use this location when I have no other option."
,jw zale,1,"There is a guy with hat working here very unfriendly and impatient, can't ask him any questions. Seems he is always busy with his own stuff and no desired to respond you with questions. He seems not like Chinese people, and don't want to waste time on them"
,Alexander Leung,5,"TLDR:
Fast and helpful service that gets the job done well.

Main Express Review:
I live in the area and this is my go to Canada Post. The experiences that I’ve had coming over 10+ time over the past year have all been pleasant. I’ve been to other places and I’ve experienced issues such at language barriers, unhelpful / stressed employees, closures without notice.

Many times I’ve been here they’ve spent extra time to help people that cannot read directions to save their firstborn. Quite impressed with how they deal with customers like these all day without ripping all their hair out.

What do you want with a Canada post?
Marine Express has it.
1. Fast. Tick.
2. Reliable. Tick.
3. Patient, helpful and offers solutions to your shipping problems. Tick.
4. Plenty of FREE parking nearby. Tick

The shop isn’t the cleanest as there’s another repair business operating in the same unit but this Canada Post has their business together.

They deserve more love for what they put in. Would definitely recommend this location to others.

I’ve always been helped by Philip. Cool guy w/ heart in this game. You’ll notice him."
,Karena T,1,Please ensure you update your hours on Google. Came last Thurs at 1pm and the store was closed. Came today (Monday) at 1pm and store was closed again. Both times google said the store would be open.
,nicole,2,Okay location. Person providing service was quick but unfriendly. Only come here out of convenience/proximity. Prefer the SDM/London Drugs Canada Post offices
,Sam Jaspar,5,Extremely helpful and quick service.
,Andrea Papp,1,"This location is permanently closed. The closest post office is now at Hastings and Kaslo.

Despite informing Google that this location is closed, including photos, they refuse to delist it from Maps or mark as permanently closed.

Rest assured, 711 and CP have terminated their contract and this location is indeed closed."
,Sibylle Stipp,1,This location CLOSED since March 2023 - Canada Post has not updated online link to state CLOSED
,Chucho Godinez (GasparIlom),1,"Post office is closed at this location, the people working at the 7-11 were not very helpfull when I asked where was the nearest Post Office."
,Michelle Baudais,1,This location is closed.  I visited today and there is no longer a post office in the 7-11 at First and Nanaimo.
,Alex Dan,1,I attempted to give this location business. They want $43 Canadian to ship a parcel. I needed a strip or two of boxing tape for the parcel. I was told by the employee I must buy a roll of boxing tape. Because they’re a privatized location. I did not give them my business instead. I’ve been to dozens of other locations that don’t mind helping out by giving a strip of tape. No customer courtesy at this location
,hammy pie,5,"My favorite post office! The lady there is always super friendly and helpful to me. She advises me when to use the Canada Post flat rate box and when to not. There's sometimes a line, but the service is fast and efficient so it's probably the customer's issue having complicated requests."
,Nicky Lee,5,I really like their customer service here. I ship a lot here as it is one of the closer Canada Posts around.  They always are willing to help and save you money by offering you the best options.  What else can you ask for.
,Sabrina T,1,*Refused my packages*. Is this a real post office? The male staff questioned me if I'm a business(I'm not) when I tried to drop off 5 packages and he said they don't accept business packages and asked me to go to other locations! Is there a sign say no business packages accepted? Is that a written policy or personal preference? However I saw a full bin of business flyers on their table lol
,Kseniya Soldatenko,5,"This is one of my favorite locations. 1st of all, it's the closest post office to my home. And 2d of all, the service is usually very fast. I ship about once avery 1-2 weeks and don't remember having any problem at this location. FYI mail pick up time for this location is usually around 4pm on business days. So I try to bring my mail before that time to catch the mail pick up."
,fanny ling,1,"I went to ship a parcel but didn’t have a box so I purchased a box there. It was clearly a used box that they were reusing, but i still payed nearly 5$ for it. When I politely asked for tape to close the box, the front lady rolled her eyes and asked why I didn’t tape it in advance/bring my own tape. How in the world am I supposed to tape it “in advance” if I bought the box on the spot??? Well she ended up charging me $1 for the tape, which I wouldn’t have been as offended if she wasn’t so sarcastic. Don’t go there. The one on oak&42nd is so much more professional and friendly."
,A KL,1,"Busy location with long line ups. They don’t communicate with people standing in line. I got to the front after waiting 30 minutes. Was told to step aside and go online to file a customs form and come back. Did that and was told by one sour faced agent to go to the back of line again. Waited another 15 minutes until the other much more pleasant and helpful agent came and took me out of the line to get my parcel sorted. She gets the star on this review.

With all the moaning and groaning Canada Post does about other shipping carriers taking their revenue and the difficult keeping Canada post workers employed -  I had two options to send two small items worth $20 to the UK. Pay $50 for air or $26 for surface which takes two months and no tracking. Never again will I ship anything nationally or internationally using Canada Post. Absolute disgrace."
,Anand Arungundram Mohan,5,"Brenda L was very helpful even though I was taking a long time to get my new debit card to work. She was professional and got the work done perfectly. I wish her the best and kudos for being so helpful to customers till the issue got resolved. I took a money order here, and it is less expensive than even what banks charge."
,HandbagBeast,1,"The workers are not helpful always. I see long queue outside London drugs because service is slow, even only 1 worker on front desk.  You can see other staff not give a hand. Personally I experienced the staff sent me away to find a cardboard inside London drugs which is not an appropriate method for my document ending up I spent 1 hour for my mail. The second time the guy sent me away again as he said my parcel has not arrived yet. I doubt if it was true. I wish the management should look into the attitude of your staff."
,dmg luxury,1,"Everytime I come and drop an item there , they just look at you. No acknowledgement, no thank you ,No greetings, no smiley faces unlike other canada post office . I know this location is busy but customer service is really bad , no feelings lol"
,JiMi S,1,"It was definitely the worst service experience in my life. I wanted to send a parcel internationally. Line up was long. I waited for 30mins. When I got to the counter, the clerk said you need to do online registry thing. (The grey unnoticeable sign about this new system was stood next to the line up but the French side was facing toward the people.) So I went to the website and they want you to register an account(+email verification) and you need to measure your parcel. But I  put some approximate numbers because I don’t have a ruler and a scale. After all the hard work, I came to counter again and the clerk said I need to cancel it and do it again because I put wrong numbers. She just measured it for validation, not for the original purpose. Anyway I gave up because I even if I pass this whole process by myself the charge was extremely expensive and delivery takes at least a month (maybe 3!). It’s shame to be named ‘Canada Post’."
,Sasan,1,Unprofessional people in this post office. They need proof of the address from Ontario which I lived 2 years ago to fwd my mails to BC . Proof of my ID and my current address were not enough for them to fwd my mails. Mails are under my name I don't understand why they need proof of the address from ON for 2 years ago. I have updated my documents to BC.
,Cuisin Art,5,Have been using this location since moving to the neighborhood in 2019. Always friendly and helpful staff. Great place to pick up your Amazon shipment and do a return. Lots of help when using MoneyGram
,Nikko Wong,1,Do not trust this post office location.  Dropped off amazon return right into hands of postal clerk and it didn't even get initial scan.  Lost my return. Never had issue with pre paid Amazon drop offs at any other Canada Post location
,Kristina Patterson,5,"Friendly, fast-service, and an overall good experience. I used to go to the post office in  Madison Centre (closer to me) however, the extra distance is totally worth it! Goes to show just how important having good customer service is. I keep coming back to this location."
,Jen Moxin,5,I've been to this location two or three times. The staff was very kind and patient.
,sandeep kaur,1,"worst service . The lady who is working there is so rude, dont even try to guide people like what to do or which envelope they required. she knows nothing about customer service.
A long waiting line. work could be done earlier we they try to help and give information at first time rather than behaving like customer must know everything."
,Ruqayyah Mohammed,1,Horrible service and the Asian man is rude. Idk his name but all the other staff are very nice but he’s horrible to speak with. He closes early before hours. Just keep that in mind if you have to come to this location.
,sagar saini,1,"The lady there, was so unprofessional and have no sense to deal with customers. She was talking rudely with bad attitude. Never going again there. She don’t even guide customers for parcel process. Wasting my two parcel envelope, in last she said this is incorrect and not acceptable."
,Rajveer Sekhon,1,"I wish it had 0 star option , I probably give that. The lady working is extremely rude and she doesn't give you full information to what to do to send a parcel. I am wondering who hired her as a front desk associate while she has no clue how to do her job."
,Molly Mangat,1,I sent package last month to India and the delivery guy said he needs money first only then he can give the package. I sent $150 and then they took Rs 2600. Reason behind the money was taxes.
,Danielle Ryan,1,"I don’t think I’ve ever had a worse Canada Post experience. The woman working here is unbelievably rude. My partner and I came in to confirm our identities for mail forwarding as we are moving. We had a few questions about how the process works and wanted confirmation that I would in fact be included in the mail forwarding to which she had no willingness to give an answer. I have worked many years in customer service facing roles and have patience for people who work in positions where they are likely to be berated all day and become frustrated, but this was 9am and the day had only begun. Would recommend you go elsewhere for your postal needs"
,Moises Schini,4,"I really like this Canada Post location. It’s very convenient, not too busy and the staff is always friendly. There’s a underground parking lot which charges $2.50 for one hour but they refund ir for minimum purchases of $5."
,Aaron Nakama,1,"One pays for parking, you get inside and yet no one is at the counter, at different hours throughout the day.

This is my 4th time here, and each time there’s been a sign saying “The post office will re-open at X:XX... so either you’re open during posted hours, or just close it down altogether."
,Sade Leschuk,1,I went to ship a package the other day and the lady kept on trying to convince me to go with the most expensive option because it has insurance coverage up to $100. In the past I have always folded my item to be the smallest possible which is what i did i’ve saved $2 per package by doing this because it takes out all of the air. After doing this the lady literally expanded my package therefore charging me more making the package carrying cloth pants to a location an hour and a half away $20
,Dina W,1,"I went there Saturday (8th of August 2020) to send an important envelope and the open hours meant 10.00-18.00. I was there 1.40 pm and to find out, someone took a break for more than an hour. The sign on the counter showed a reopen time at 2.50 pm. It's unbelievable. A washroom break for 5 min I can understand, but a lunch break for more than an hour should be covered."
,Allstone,1,This store does not cover their staff while on break. I have come twice now where the staff have been on break with no coverage  not convenient at all and not very customer focused.
,Andri Sadlak,2,"The official schedule says this post office is open on Sunday 10 am - 6 pm. I showed up with a huge and heavy package at 1:40 and nobody’s there with a sign “we’ll be back at 2” and “do not drop off any parcels or returns while we are closed”.

I wait until 2:05 for them to actually accept my package.

I only give them two stars for wasting so much customers’ time because they trued to notice when they’ll be back."
,Ben Cooner,5,A lot of Karens and Daves complaints. The individuals working and giving a service are just like you and me.. A Life. Use a courier if you  are so desperate.
,Trilby Wiens,5,I've always had friendly helpful service at this post office and not waited more than 5 minutes. I felt like hugging the staff after we moved here and I came for the first time... I was so used to being treated like a big inconvenience by staff at my last post office. Thank you!
,Jessi Pomeroy,2,"Normally great, closed over an hour early could not drop off my parcel. No notice or indication of adjusted hours."
,Cheryl McKelvey,5,"I visited this post office many times, and had a great experience each time.  There is a mature lady there at the counter who was so helpful when i put in my change of address, and also when i sent back my telus equipment.
Best service in town here, plus they really know Cda Post regs and policies.  Likely these people are all employees of Cda Post, not drug store employees who are responsible for learning everything in 1 week. I would not go anywhere else for anything semi-complex."
,Milajade Collections,5,"I guess there care about my business.  I've been using this post office for my companies documents and packages for years now.  My relationship with them is great, when I have a package that I missed waiting for me in my PO Box, they will send me a text or call me if it's at risk of being returned.  I would assume not many post offices would do that for their customers as many are almost hostile to their customers.  Glad I found this little gem of west van postal glory :)"
,Paul Silverstone,1,"I live in Park Royal Towers.   The mail delivery is the worst I have experienced.   Today is Monday the week after Labor Day weekend.   I subscribe to several magazines costing me  hundreds of dollars, some with time sensitive news.   I have  not received a single magazine in over 10 days.  Some are weekly mailed in Canada.   It is infuriating that I am not receiving my magazines in a timely fashion.    I would like to a better delivery system."
,Caity McDaniel,5,"This was some of the best customer service I have ever experienced. Every single person was accommodating, and they went completely out of their way to make sure I had a nice day. I would 100% recommend going to this post office! Although I was there for business, I may have to go there each time for my own mailing, even though I live in a different city! 5 stars."
,Aftaab Gulam,5,Fantastic service at the post office here. The staff are kind and courteous and always willing to go out of their way to accommodate all kinds of questions and requests.
,Yo Sep Lee,1,"I am hoping that I could give minus point
Even they were able to put my parcel on the mail box in the condo, arbitrarily dropped them at the post office for picking up so that I have to be experienced today's unpleasant event.
Mikami? Monami?
Before invoking regulation, don't you think you should stick to the rules?
Or you don't get to think before you spit it out."
,Jawad “Jawz” Ahmad,1,"No stationary, no assistance very surprising for a Postal company branch. No money orders available either. Guy wasn't helpful either on suggestions or pointers to another much more useful branch."
,Patrick Valdes,5,"It was half an hour before closing and it wasn't that busy today, though it was still steady. Whenever I have visited in the past, Joella, I think is what the Canada Post' rep's name was (on my receipt), she's always helpful with all customers!"
,Nicholas Au-Yeung,1,"AJAYPAL is super rude and unhelpful.

The lady infront of me was simply trying to mail a letter out but he made things super complicated for the lady. He ignores her question and replied with answers that were completely irrelevant.

She even ask the ""value"" of a written letter...."
,SAA G.,1,"One star seems too much!

December 1st 2021 around 11 am, I went there for a parcel pick up. Tried to explain to this clerk my situation and he got super passive aggressive, very rude, wouldn't even bother listening to me, wasted my time and gave me the wrong Poste Canada customer service phone line to call. Felt he like he didn't even want to work. Horrible experience!!"
,Guillaume Pelletier,1,"I’m so sorry to be rude, but the lady who works here doesn’t have two brain cells to rub together.

She complains that packages are too heavy, complains that there are too many packages, complains complains complains. Listen, dear lady… this is your job! Plenty of people would be happy to take your place.

She makes up weird rules about package measurements. She argues and berates even when you try and tell her you agree. She doesn’t make any sense. I don’t know what her problem is. Every single time I go there I have a hard time.

Go to any other Canada Post office and you will have a normal level of service."
,Kyal Scott,5,"Spoke on the phone with Christina about a missing item issue I had. She was lovely, warm and very specific with her help. Thanks again Christina!"
,Justin West,1,"Major snow storm this week, but I had to get a package out. After all, Christmas is on Sunday. Well, the folks at this location decided to close early (5pm) and just left a sign on the counter. They did peak their head out the window of the mail room and saw me, but quickly ducked so that they didn't actually have to come out and serve. Why? They are their, patrons who made it there had to brave the cold, slippery sidewalks, terrible driving conditions... why not just stay open, or at the very least, post something on line so people don't wait their time and safety."
,Jess Watson,1,"Horrible customer service, will actively avoid this location because of one specific employee that there’s countless reviews on here about."
,Mert Akbal,1,"I agree with everybody.  Same experience. They dismiss you although your parcel is right there in the back. I had to do a second trip there and it ruined my work day. I didn’t even mean to make the first trip, it was such an inconvenience.
1)You can just go back and check if you have a parcel for a name or address if delivery man forgot to drop the barcode. It has been done before in other Canada Post pick up locations. Why not? It is super easy.
2)The way you dismiss people and say “it is not me, I am not Canada post” is just unhinged. How would you feel if you went to some company’s supposed “location” and the people in uniform would say “I am not working for them”"
,Suleimy Rios Aguilar,3,"The location is great, close to the Metro station. I visit the location for the first time on Wednesday afternoon and the guy was rude, he saw me at the front desk but I took my time as I saw he was looking for a package after 5 minutes he decided to ask me ""what do you want?"" in a very rude way. I send letters often and this is the first time someone from the staff is rude or unfriendly, I request a stamp and he asked me ""cash or what?"", once I paid what the staff usually do is to give me the stamp and I place it but this time the guy place my stamp on the wrong position and almost in the middle of the envelope, I had to take it carefully to place it in the right place, trying not to break it. I know we all have bad days but unfortunately, I was not the only one as there were more people in line, dealing with his attitude."
,The Unboxer,1,"Bad service. They need to hire people who can speak proper English. The lady at counter refused to send my packaged wrist watch. After agreeing to accepting my package, all of a sudden she says her computer stopped working. That is ridiculous. Staff is untrained and doesn't speak proper English. Its sad to see you can't get professional. This is whats wrong with our unionized employees.."
,Ila Varshney,4,Very quick service. The lady on the store is very helpful. She not only suggested me best way to send my parcel but also helped me in regulating the maximum weight I can send in parcel. FYI- there are 2 ladies 1 is really helpful and other is super rude. You can easily notice the difference. Overall this location is far far better than Canada Post in Aberdeen center.
,Jana Evans,1,"Very bad service today. I usually find Indian lady here who is beyond helpful  but today there was short older lady, gray hair in longish bob who didn't even smiled. She was so overwhelmed by the work saying it is so busy and there were only few people in the line up which is normal for the postal office. I often send packages and the post office person always gives me an advice on what is the best and cheapest way. The Indian lady would always recommend how many packages to have and what weight not to reach etc. The same happens in Highgate mall Post Office where I go often as well. But today, the woman  just rejected all my questions repeating she is too busy (with 3 people waiting) . I decided not to send anything and just left.
If the job is too much for her and she cannot handle it, she shouldn't be doing it then. I know for the fact she is the exception as other people there are super helpful and fast at the same time.
UPDATE: Went to HighGate Mall Post Office in Burnaby last night. The person there helped me of course. First we tried to fit in the box but the weight was too much. Then he suggested the envelope, the same one I tried in Richmond but the cost here for the same service, same envelope  same weight and same destination  ended up costing 3 times less than what she told me. And all this while he had lineup twice as long as she did."
,Sul Haji,5,"Just went to post office at shoppers at 11am today, she was super busy and was handling still with excellent customer service. I needed to find a depot for our mail service and she found it for me!. Our own strata couldn't tell where it was but she found it for me. I am amazed at her customer service!"
,Bri,3,"Literally never open when they say they are. Have been short staffed for a year, so almost always close at 4pm. I recommend calling before..

Update - they’ve gotten much better! I still call before going though just to be safe."
,Sam Mansour,5,"Everybody here rocks!  Through all of the heavy seasons Canada Post, including this location, are a well-oiled machine!  The folks at this location are: Friendly, well-humored, welcoming, excellently trained and downright a part of the family.  The management should commend the people here.  Good stuff!!"
,Bren Da,5,"BIG thank you to the staff member that was working Dec 17 around 5-7pm. They helped me with a package that I needed URGENTLY. It had been delayed for a couple weeks, not delivered to my home and re routed to this office. I came in while they were quite busy near closing time but they still tended to me with the best customer service ever. LIFE SAVER!!!!!! You're the best."
,Brody Isaak,4,occasionally short staffed but always nice when you get to the front of the line
,Livia,1,"I’m at home, side by side with my phone on loud, and just got a notification that my parcel is here (again) to pick up because they could not “find me”. This time I essentially needed my package because has essential things on it. So tired of Canada Post laziness!"
,M K,1,"Poor service
Today was my last day to pick up my important letter before 9pm. I call them and let them know that i will be there at 8pm and im here at 8pm but they tell me that they sent my letter back today after i called them and told them i will be there. Why would they send the letter back 1 day before the deadline?????
The csr didnt have the answer for that and kept blaming her co worker.
Cant rely on canada post"
,Amarachi Ifeanacho,1,"Incompetent staff, she didn't put a tracking number on my mail and now my documents are lost.. I feel so frustrated"
,Callum O'Hare,1,"Bunch of extremely by-the-books robots working here. If you're out of tape or need to borrow a market for 15 seconds, go to literally any other Canada Post.

I waited a good 10 minutes behind one customer just to ask if I could use a Sharpie and eventually left the line to really nicely ask Zach - who was behind the counter - if he could pass me the one two steps away from him (rather than making the now 6-person line wait while I fill out the address) I called him by name, was really nice, and Zach just told me to wait in the now-extra-long line that I just left so that I could ask the extremely busy lady for one. He then walked away to refill milk.

The next day I learned that I probably wouldn't have gotten that Sharpie anyway. I came back and the guy in front of me took a solid 10 minutes again to ship an item. He asked if he could use the tape and the lady told him he had to purchase tape - they can't provide any. This then resulted in a multiple minutes long debate about why she can't just toss a piece of tape on the box. It's a post office - they have tape. They sell boxes without tape yet made this poor dude spent 6 bucks on packing tape that he left on the counter when he left. I travel a lot and this is easily one of the slowest and least helpful Canada Post locations I've ever been to in the entire country."
,Tu Huynh,1,"extremely stupid and terrible service, the driver delivered my package to the wrong place after 6 days and when i checked with the Canada post to find it, they didn't help me to find and solve the problem, the service is really slow and time-consuming!"
,Pratik,5,"Visited today to send my passport. Kim, the post office manager was very courteous and helpful in assisting me with the process. Also, the associate at the counter was spontaneous and generous. Thank you team for all your help. Cheers😊"
,Hannah W,1,"Cash or debit only. Also refuse to do door delivery if there are outstanding duties. What is the point in paying delivery if you have to pick it up yourself?

Covid so I can’t pay the delivery driver? Okay so I have to now go indoors and do the same thing and pay the cashier. Avoid this location at all costs."
,Katharine Woods,5,This is a family run store with a Canada Post outlet.  They are friendly and efficient here.
,Tanya Sutherland,1,"I received a package very damaged, the item inside was ruined. The guy must've been extremely embarrassed dropping it off in that state. My reason for returning was because of that, the damage. I didn't have any tape to fix the huge damage to the box, and was forced to BUY tape so I can fix it. Me? Fix your mistake and have to pay for it?! The man was very rude and was all up in my business trying to tell me how to pack. It's covid 19 sir, stay 6 feet away from me! If you're going to make me BUY TAPE TO FIX YOUR ISSUE I'm going to do it my way. Absolute waste of my time and ruined my day. Hope I never have to deal with this place again."
,Sarah S,1,"Do not have amazon packages sent here. I picked up one here thinking it would be safer than having it left outside my door, however it was already opened and empty. They  shrugged and told me to contact amazon. Next time I'll take my chances with porch pirates."
,Mark Angelski,1,"My wife works from home, carrier never delivers packages, always leaves slips,  if they knocked it would save us a trip, lazy mail people"
,Davis Horowitz,1,"Woman with short red hair is really bad. First sat there in line while she didn't attend to any customers. She finally comes out and speaks to everyone rudly before me. When it's my turn she doesn't accept my change of address from the government to pick up my package because I accidently brought the one for my health card. I then mention how if I was able to change it on my Healthcare it is automatically updated for license as well so it still proves where I live. She then mentioned that it is policy, despite the fact of picking up many packages this way. Don't know where people with the smallest amount of power let it go to their heads. She must have something else going on in her life to be this rude."
,Bảo Trần,1,"I placed three sealed letters in the Canada Post mailbox addressed to residents who moved out, writing clearly ""RETURN TO SENDER!"" Whoever sent it back to my mailbox needs to stop playing this stupid game. Think real hard what am I supposed to do with strangers' mail?"
,Dorothy Lamond,5,I found the staff at this location very friendly and helpful.  Totally appreciate their professional and polite support.  Wish we had more people like these girls.  Thank you
,Stephanie Swartz,5,Best post office location in Westmount. The staff is patient and kind. It’s the customers who are terrible and rude. I send out packages regularly for business and have witnessed Customers be absolutely disgusting the staff put up with a lot and are always professional and lovely. Pam is super helpful and always knows the best way to get things to their destination
,A,1,"Pam needs to be fired. The attitude pouring from her was very unprofessional. Do not ask someone a question then cut them off then get snarky when you didn't hear the answer.
I get everyone has a bad day but that wasn't the first time she's been like that. If you hate your job that much just quit and find a job where you don't have to deal with people."
,Gizem A.,1,Terrible post office..where you supposed stay in line is confusing..they want us to block the aisle where people are shopping. I lined up where I wont be blocking but was treated like I was the one who is rude...
,Chrisinlondon,5,"The young man who I believe is a Western university student is a pleasure dealing with. He was pleasant, polite and humorous."
,Fatima Badr,1,"I feel like those posting the bad reviews are all talking about the same worker, including myself. She is probably the rudest customer service representative that I’ve ever interacted with. Not only does she regularly interrupt me when I have questions, but she also treated my mom with obvious disrespect when she went there alone. Why is this still hapenning??"
,monitor,1,"I wouldn't even give out one star if there is a zero score I can choose from. I was there twice for mailing my letters. Neither of them was pleasant experience. Seems the staff there is sick of dealing with immigrants, not friendly, not patient, but the staff is very excited when talking to male customers. After processing my case, she apparently was not very happy with me. While I was standing at the side of the counter and filling in the envelope, she was chatting with a male customer who was after me that she was sick of dealing with idiots, which, in her terms, are the people like me whose English is not our first language.  Such being the case, I won't go that post office anymore and give her more workloads."
,Dora Bells,1,So rude!!!. I wish I can pick up my package somewhere else that had people with nice attitude. I should have give 0 star on those 2 oldies...racist 😖
,Walii Auto,1,I lost very important document through Canada post this location they are not helpful. They gave me a 1800 number to call. I don’t recommend dealing with any Canada post in the future. It was a priority registered mail
,Den Maldoon,5,"Great and helpful workers, have had multiple experiences with different workers, all have gone above and beyond helping me, new to sending parcels, have had different workers help me pack, label, even give me filler materials when my items to ship were too small for the flat rate boxes, always polite and helpful ladies that work there, would recommend it"
,Joshua Klassen,4,"I was nervous to go here after reading the reviews, however from my 10+ visits so far, I've realized the issues aren't with the employees but rather the customers.

No one understands how to mail anything. The customers argue with the employees like they know how to do the job better. I swear it seems like mailing something is a new invention considering no one understands how it works.

The reason for the 4 stars is because of the sometimes long wait times. Not because of the employees, but because of the customers.

Tip for those reading this;

You need the FULL address of the person you're shipping to. Don't argue with the employees when they tell you the postal code or building number is missing.

Decide if you want tracking or not NOW, instead of spending 5 minutes deciding when there's a line of people behind you as if you can't believe you're being asked such a crazy question. Yes, it DOES cost more.

Lastly, have your money ready. Also, look up this crazy new invention called tap. You can pay in less than 3 seconds. It really shouldn't take you a full 3 minutes to pay.

Overall this place is fine. I've never had issues with any employees. From when it's my turn in line, to when I'm walking away with my receipt, it takes roughly 30-60 seconds. I also appreciate that they all seem to wear their masks fully and properly."
,Alannah,3,"I would rate less but Sarah did try to help me. I went to deliver a package which was a return of a cable box I no longer needed. I approached the desk and asked for help as I have no experience with it at all. Sarah seemed really nice but right before she could explain things, Judy jumped in and basically pointed to the wall and made me feel dumb. I continued to have questions about where to  place stickers and how to package the parcel properly. Sarah did her best to answer  but was busy with other customers and also heard her say she was in training. When it came time to ship, Judy cashed me out and I left paying 30 dollars. I feel like if they would have taken the time to show me correctly I wouldnt have payed that much. I can now see that she has many bad reviews and I think this company should do something about her terrible customer service. Even though this location is closest to me I will now drive out of my way to avoid Judy."
,Just Some Guy without a Cool Tattoo,1,Called ahead to confirm they  handled FedEx.  They said they did as long as it was to outside Canada (it was going to America) and there was no PO box (there wasn't).  When I got there they were rude and informed me they didn't even though I was informed by them that they did.  I was offered no apologies for my wasted trip and time.  Awful service and incompetent staff.
,Jasmine Gales,1,i feel Customer Service is very low here i moved form small town where they were helpful today as soon as got in the door my envaolpe poped open i didnt think it was big deal but the lady took one look and sighed and told me everything and packages must be ready when had told her what happened she just sighed again it just needed some tape :
,Rachel,1,"If I could rate this half a star or less, I would. The customer service is terrible and everyone seems like they’re constantly having a bad day and doesn’t care about anything at all. They are unable to use professional judgement whatsoever or think outside of the box when ‘solving’ issues. Seriously don’t go here…like ever."
,Tom V,1,"SADA was incredibly rude, leaving me mid-conversation several times because she was ‘unable to help’.
Having an item delivered to the post office is supposed to be less of a hassle than having it stolen while you’re not home. I wish I had taken my chances, rather than being forced to deal with this person who is evidently miserable."
,Jessica Joyce,5,"The cashier named Karen was so helpful and kind to me, even though she had a huge lineup of clients to get through. Karen saved me an hour of my life! Thank you Karen!!!"
,Hashim Cheema,1,"Worst customer service ever! I definitely agree with the other reviews that the two service women are bias towards any one who looks international. Especially the white woman who has a very rude tone and a look of disgust if it is your first time. Nonetheless, do not let that rude woman ruin your day or make you a bad person. Treat her with respect and respectfully tell her she needs to fix her attitude and treat customers equally regardless of skin colour. It is unfortunate the great name of Canada Post is being tarnished by this woman and her rude attitude and extremely poor customer service."
,Kenneth Chisholm,5,"This place has superior hours than dedicated Canada Post outlets, but the best use for it is as a ideal secure pickup point for online orders from Amazon and the like.  With all the complaints about ""porch pirates,"" stealing deliveries from homes, this is an obvious delivery alternative that seems so under-recognized for online shoppers.  In addition, it has a full selection of postal supplies for regular mail as well, on top of the small selection of PO Boxes."
,Phanutang Quinine Richigan,5,"Ordered a Keurig-compatible pod in a flavour they didn't sell in London, Ontario. Pomegranite Iced Tea. The service was a and b the c of d"
,robert scott,5,Friendly staff - even the store postal staff can’t understand why postal service can’t leave things at my door as I have requested 100 💯 times
,E. B.,3,I wish I could change my pick-up location. I really don’t want to have to pay $8 for parking just to pick up my package. City parking is much cheaper but obviously always full so hopefully the city gives some lenience for illegal parking lol.
,Marnie C,1,They don't pick up the phone. I needed to call to get information about a missing package and they would either hangup on me or redirect me to shopper's drug mart's customer service who obviously can't help me.
,Karim El-Sherif,1,"guy at the post office doing training, had to flip a toonie, 2 or 3 times, looking for denomination on it, before the woman training him told him it's 2$."
,James Kraemer,5,"The two employees who helped my partner and I today were exceptional.
Very helpful, fast and efficient. Specifically The gentleman with long hair and a tattoo on his arm… shout out to him.

Five stars."
,Jin Cha,1,"One star is too high of a rating for this place. I just spent 45 min in line watching 2 people 'help' one customer ignoring the LONG line formed as a result. Try this-one person help her and then tell her to move over to fill out and pack her stuff herself, but the second staff should have been helping the other customers. Not a rocket science folks! They were absolutely incompetent! I was there from 3:00 - 3:45pm...this is the time I spent in line!"
,Toto,1,"I hate Canada post, expensive, slow, not reliable, especially delivery guys are worst, they never attempt to deliver the package but they just take it to the post office for pickup, they just like to work less, more money, awful."
,Fiona Qi,1,Would give a zero if I could. On the delivery notice says close at 8pm on Saturday and when we went there it says close on 4pm. Every time we went there the employees act lack of no common sense. First in my life I want to move to other area because of a postal office.
,Jeff N,5,Kaitlin at the post office desk is an extremely helpful and friendly person. She has assisted me with multiple shipments and each time it was a very pleasant experience. Canada Post needs more employees like Kaitlin.
,michael fox,5,Preferred location for shipping and picking up MoneyGram.  Staff knowledgeable and helpful.   Sometimes have to wait for various reasons but overall still one of better Canada post for overall service in London   Trust me I tried a lot of them
,Juliana Nielson,5,Canada post is a great place for shipping parcels cards etc. Just down the street from me so very handy 🙂
,Fressia Rivas,1,"I dropped off a return to Amazon a month ago, now Amazon said they never received the package. Now they are not responsible for those pre paid packages. Not going here anymore."
,Helen M,1,This place has not been open 5 times in the past 2 weeks I've tried to go here to ship an item. Just left now at 2:45pm in the afternoon and the counter is closed. This would explain why my mail service is so slow. Extremely over priced shipping and closes at random.
,Justin Petrillo,5,"The reviews here about the long lines are funny. “No one goes there; it's too crowded.”
It's a perfectly fine post office. I enjoy going! In my experience, the staff are nice and helpful. I do try to get there earlier in the day when possible."
,isaac hicks,1,"The old man Shawn that works here needs either to be let go or retrained. I have dropped my prepaid packages at this post office more then a handful of times without hassle and usually with very quick shipping, HOWEVER when Shawn works the desk he needs me to stand there while he rings in over 30 of my packages or he says he won’t take them… the lady there bev I believe is her name overheard this and came over and assured me if I dont need a receipt that I don’t need to stand there and hold Shawn’s hand while he rings in my packages and that I can leave them to the side and they well be rang in accordingly….

I guess Shawn didn’t like being  wrong because my packages some how managed not to get rang in for tracking and the late shipping times are screwing with our metrics …
Management needs to get involved or head office will be informed . Ridiculous behaviour from a grown man.."
,Lauren Fraumeni,1,"Every single time i go to the post office to return a package or pick one up the man there is always rude and gives me a hard time. There is also a blonde lady a bit older who is just as rude. They make me feel stupid and like i don’t know anything. I’m not the one who works there so obviously i’m not going to know all the little stuff. They need to get nicer staff, because they are literally all so freaken rude."
,alexj schther,1,Terrible place. Rude and undereducated stuff especially the blonde long hair lady. These dummies need to be all fired and this place needs to start over again.
,Edward Tay,1,Just like everyone else has said. The man at the post office desk is the grumpiest most rude man I have ever met. They have had my package forever and refuse to give it to me because I don't have a drivers license. He just pushes me away. HE NEEDS TO BE FIRED! The woman is very nice and always finds other ways to verify my identity.
,Katalin Kiara Klein-Szalai,1,"Why do I get triplicate and quadruplicate flyers for the same sale period? Such an abuse of the environment.  Extra trees are cut and logged to print these flyers, chemicals produce pollution by manufacturing the ink, plastics create toxic air and it's garbage takes 500 years to decompose in the garbage. Not to mention the unsightly garbage created by people throwing them in the garbage, being blown around by wind and so on.
The clerks at the desk are arbitrarily either accept or reject identification presented and are not very friendly at all.
Why such waste from here and why such abuse of our planet?
Real mail that should be delivered within 5 business days takes over 10 business days or longer yet flyers arrive every day."
,Michael Lee,5,"Absolutely amazing customer service. The reviews didn't lie. I often have trouble finding a Canada Post office with great employees, but this one was very good. I was sending 2 different packages, and both were dealt in professional manner. When I asked for several options, they were patient, and courteous. They were also very knowledgeable in giving me the option that I wanted when sending parcels and mails. I really appreciated the good customer service here. Recommended."
,tina nguyen,1,"Worst post office , I went there 7:15 pm , the girl saw me and said she s in her break and will be back at 7:45 pm , I had to wait there , at least they should have some other staff ,"
,L. B.,1,"The woman working here has the worst customer service skills. This is the second time that I designated someone to pick up my package (it's an option when you check-out on amazon) and they would not let the designated person pick it up even though their name was on the package. This can be a major accessibility issue for many customers! Most importantly, the woman we dealt with was extremely rude, disrespectful, and completely careless about her customers. I don't know how she has a job in a customer service industry but that needs to change."
,Cody Dunn,5,"The staff that work both the shoppers and separate staff for Canada Post have all be en polite and informative for me
Now this location has had its share of troubles from some unruly and thieving people but they all hold their own so they can continually work and help any customer with the required professionalism and politeness we can expect even during such trying times with covid 19 lurking all around us. Try to be as polite as possible and if you have some disabilities please see a manager for any business ideas you have or required service enhancements while you are on their business premises
Thanks guys stay safe with gloves and masks!!!"
,Pulkit Lamba,1,"If you don’t want to work, please close the shop. Please do not provide stupid reasons to ‘Be on the phone’ and just get rid of the customer. Pathetic work ethic. Apr 15 Saturday 10:52 am"
,Tomas Castillo,1,"The lady working here has the WORST customer service skille, rude, no work ethic."
,Banan Alrajie,1,"Every time I go there I decide that I will never go back but because it is the closest to my house I kept going but today I decided that it’s my last time!!
Not professional AT ALL!!"
,Jason Mugford,1,Very poor service. Staff was unwilling to even look for a package of mine when I received the delivery notice. I previously worked as a post office clerk myself and am used to accommodating customers. The lady here is severely lacking of any close to competence in customer service. Suggestion: take your business elsewhere and save the stress.
,chris swain,5,Always love coming to this location to get my many parcels. The staff are very polite and helpful. I call over all the time and they will take the time to take a look to see if a particular parcel is in and many times I can go over and retrieve it a day sooner than waiting for the pickup card from the postman. They go above and beyond here.
,Rafael Meyer,5,"Just watch out because the post is actually inside the pharmacy, so dont get lost. Really helpful people working in there, I appreciate your help!"
,John R,1,Dont expect any help here. They do not have a number for contact
,George W,4,I use the service here quite a bit. It tends to be good but it can be slow if it’s busy.
,Yokhesh KTS,5,
,Dhawal,1,"The old man working at this location is rude and completely non-courteous. He even went ahead and gave himself rating on the screen on behalf of customer and in front of the customer.
Kindly hire courteous staff!"
,Jay,1,Trash post office. Terrible customer service. Options that were available a couple months ago aren’t available now ? They’re not set up to print anything ? Crazy definitely avoid
,Ravneet Hansra,1,"There was an old guy who was really really rude. I was standing for 20 minutes, very slow and poor service. Really bad experience."
,Dominic Goncalves (domocorn),5,Locations is very close to my house and have never had an issue with anyone there.
,Noah Porter,1,I use this location all the time for dropping off/picking up post as I live down the street. I have never had one good experience dealing with the employees here. They are extremely rude  and unhelpful. I now drive well out of my way to avoid this location. I suggest you do the same.
,Justin Steinburg,1,I sent Christmas gifts from this location but when it arrived the contents had been stolen and the box filled with useless filler. When I told the employees here they were no help. It was devastating.
,Christopher Paul Bettridge,4,"Well, it was ironically very frustrating for me because the service that I went there to make use of was unfortunately not to bed for me. But this wasn't sure to any fault or flaw of Canada Post, but rather of the American business whom wouldn't accept EI to either my birth certificate my SIN card or my Health Card as viable proof of identity, not even with my address proven by mailed sealed government envelope to me or my lease or anything else, and so.....
I was denied access to something very important. The reason I state all this is because despite this problem, the staff member entry out of his way, including going online for multiple searches, to try to find a way to help me. He took my repressed let's be nice and just say I was 'put out' (I was furious~but not at him and he responded to that) emotions calmly and even helped me settle myself. When I apologized for any inconveniences he said I was fine and that he totally understood. His advice will, eventually, lead me to acquire what I was expecting that afternoon, expecting with no motion at all I would be denied since I..... never mind! Nice guy. I mean, he really helped me out. Not that I was shouting or cursing or anything! 😇 So.... though my mission ended in abject failure, my experience of my first visit to Canada Post for myself in my 43 years was overall quite positive. Who'd a thought? 🤔🇨🇦🙃"
,Kenneth Chisholm,4,"When I had to make my first return to Amazon, the staff here knew exactly what toi advise a beginner like me oif what to do.  That is an exemplery example of service from this crown corporation."
,Tess,5,"Amazing!! They know rates, they know good packaging, they know stamps, and they will answer kindly any Post question put to them. These are very experienced postal workers. I thought we had lost the wonders of the post office, and its expertise, when Shopper's and other private outlets were allowed to move mail. And we did except for the remaining Canada Post outlets, like this one. May they last."
,James Doumanas,5,"There is a young man at this office who  makes a habit of keeping own area clean and hazard-free and also assists and encourages others to do the same. Polite, courteous, respectful and charming at all times and in all situations, without being obsequious. Unfailingly courteous even when dealing with a difficult person or situation. Reaches a decision rapidly after taking account of all likely outcomes and estimating the route most likely to bring success. The decisions almost always turn out to be good ones. He will always willingly and successfully try to do what is required, even if it means performing tasks that are not in the job description or if required to do extra work unexpectedly.

Able to concentrate and stay focused for periods of several hours, even when tasks are relatively mundane, and doesn't make mistakes. He has a high boredom threshold."
,Damien Bayless,1,Save yourself the frustration of poor customer service (not helpful) and use the Greenhills post office instead. Gave it a few chances and Greenhills is just far superior for customer service and helpfulness!

,N N,1,"Bad services. Hiren the employee was not professional, he kept helping other customers while I kept waiting to be helped. He did not ask the lady to wait untill he is done helping me. People would interrupt the service but it's the employee's duty to have them respect others and wait in line."
,Purva Mehta,1,"Bad service, always giving trouble"
,Corey Isaacs,5,The person who helped me was very friendly and professional.
,Christina S.,5,"Fast friendly service.  Nice variety store with gifts,  cards and other selections."
,Renee Vecchio,1,Very upsetting to see my package on the dirty floor. The lady working took 5 min to find it while tossing other packages about all over the floor and the counter . Had to come 3 times to retrieve a single package because they were too busy blowing up balloons to help me . When I finally did have time to wait for my package I had to wait almost 20 minutes as a single woman was doing passport photos as well as managing the desk . As I left I asked the man at the cash if he carried something and he flung his hand in my direction and said “over there on the bottom” I clearly could not see where he was pointing and ended up walking out.
,killlz01,5,Hands down the best Canada Post in London!!!  Friendly employees and owners!!  Very helpful everytime!!!  My only go to!!
,Akshay Patel,5,Staff is always helpful to me at any time. Good place to get everything.

I don't either which is why I'm writing this, Brenda!"
,Joy to the world,1,The worst ever. People make time to come in and  yet they're updating the system at 3 in the afternoon... Prime time for people to come in. Can't they update the system before opening or close to closing? Wasted time and I still have to find another time to go in.
,MOHAMMED Abuammrs,1,The girl who works for them is very arrogant and does not respect anyone and does not help anyone. The service is very bad

,Asad,1,They take forever
,Ray Falconer,1,"I have 2 experiences, both with the young gentleman behind the counter.  Back in December this gentleman refused me Service and immediately made a scene and closed the location before 5:00 pm... he was acting like he owned the joint... ? Maybe he does? However he phoned police because of ...What.? Maybe he is a Big Man....?
Yesterday, on the wake up and  take the mask off day... like... I went in with a big smile and these frightened workers all wore their muzzles... I don't care what they do ... well the young gentleman get this... he threatened me ... if he ever saw me out of here... he suggested he would physically harm me... ?

This fine young gentleman who thinks he is a big man in his corporation ... should understand that he has liable not only himself but the Corporation he represents....  so when you phone my business and you say that I will be charged for trespassing... when you actually broke many laws going against the Supreme Law... and the Canadian Bill Rights... and the Canadian Constitution.... this young gentleman should be ashamed to call himself a Canadian...!"
,Gabe Boldt,1,"I showed up at 11am today (May 6,2020) to find out the store was closed. There was no notification of this online or via telephone. Very poor customer service in my opinion!"
